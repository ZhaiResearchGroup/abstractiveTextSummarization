    "This is made possible by the simple but powerful idea of the [sequence to sequence network](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215), in which two recurrent neural networks work together to transform one sequence to another. An encoder network condenses an input sequence into a single vector, and a decoder network unfolds that vector into a new sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "To improve upon this model we'll use an [attention mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473), which lets the decoder learn to focus over a specific range of the input sequence. This is initially designed for data-driven language translation, in which case the length of input and output sequence is approximately similar. For text summarization task, in which case the output sequence is much shorter then the input, the model didn't perform that well. Some other tricks should be explored soon. "

    "# The Sequence to Sequence model\n",
    "\n",
    "A [Sequence to Sequence network](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215), or seq2seq network, or [Encoder Decoder network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078v3.pdf), is a model consisting of two separate RNNs called the **encoder** and **decoder**. The encoder reads an input sequence one item at a time, and outputs a vector at each step. The final output of the encoder is kept as the **context** vector. The decoder uses this context vector to produce a sequence of outputs one step at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/tVtHhNp.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a single RNN, there is a one-to-one relationship between inputs and outputs. We would quickly run into problems with different sequence orders and lengths that are common during translation. Consider the simple sentence \"Je ne suis pas le chat noir\" &rarr; \"I am not the black cat\". Many of the words have a pretty direct translation, like \"chat\" &rarr; \"cat\". However the differing grammars cause words to be in different orders, e.g. \"chat noir\" and \"black cat\". There is also the \"ne ... pas\" &rarr; \"not\" construction that makes the two sentences have different lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the seq2seq model, by encoding many inputs into one vector, and decoding from one vector into many outputs, we are freed from the constraints of sequence order and length. The encoded sequence is represented by a single vector, a single point in some N dimensional space of sequences. In an ideal case, this point can be considered the \"meaning\" of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea can be extended beyond sequences. Image captioning tasks take an [image as input, and output a description](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4555) of the image (img2seq). Some image generation tasks take a [description as input and output a generated image](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02793) (seq2img). These models can be referred to more generally as \"encoder decoder\" networks."

    "## The Attention Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "The fixed-length vector carries the burden of encoding the the entire \"meaning\" of the input sequence, no matter how long that may be. With all the variance in language, this is a very hard problem. Imagine two nearly identical sentences, twenty words long, with only one word different. Both the encoders and decoders must be nuanced enough to represent that change as a very slightly different point in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **attention mechanism** [introduced by Bahdanau et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) addresses this by giving the decoder a way to \"pay attention\" to parts of the input, rather than relying on a single vector. For every step the decoder can select a different part of the input sentence to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/5y6SCvU.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention is calculated with another feedforward layer in the decoder. This layer will use the current input and hidden state to create a new vector, which is the same size as the input sequence (in practice, a fixed maximum length). This vector is processed through softmax to create *attention weights*, which are multiplied by the encoders' outputs to create a new context vector, which is then used to predict the next output.\n",

    "The solution to the teacher-forcing \"problem\" is known as [Scheduled Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03099), which simply alternates between using the target values and predicted values when training. We will randomly choose to use teacher forcing with an if statement while training - sometimes we'll feed use real target as the input (ignoring the decoder's output), sometimes we'll use the decoder's output."
