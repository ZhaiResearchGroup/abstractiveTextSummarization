brother peter who had been involved in behind the lines operations in norway and greece during the war <sos> [ 3 ] aside from fleming ' s brother a number of others also provided some aspects of bond ' s make up including conrad o ' brien ffrench patrick dalzel job and bill "" biffy "" dunderdale [ 2 ] <sos> the name james bond came from that of the american ornithologist james bond a caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide birds of the west indies <sos> fleming a keen birdwatcher himself had a copy of bond ' s guide and he later explained to the ornithologist ' s wife that "" it struck me that this brief unromantic anglo saxon and yet very masculine name was just what i needed and so a second james bond was born "" <sos> [ 4 ] he further explained that : <sos> when i wrote the first one in 1953 i wanted bond to be an extremely dull uninteresting man to whom things happened ; i wanted him to be a blunt instrument when i was casting around for a name for my protagonist i thought by god [ james bond ] is the dullest name i ever heard — ian fleming the new yorker 21 april 1962 [ 5 ] <sos> on another occasion fleming said : "" i wanted the simplest dullest plainest sounding name i could find ' james bond ' was much better than something more interesting like ' peregrine carruthers ' <sos> exotic things would happen to and around him but he would be a neutral figure—an anonymous blunt instrument wielded by a government department "" [ 6 ] <sos> hoagy carmichael—fleming ' s view of james bond <sos> fleming decided that bond should resemble both

relatives and lovers throughout his books [ 2 ] <sos> it was not until the penultimate novel you only live twice that fleming gave bond a sense of family background <sos> the book was the first to be written after the release of dr no in cinemas and sean connery ' s depiction of bond affected fleming ' s interpretation of the character to give bond both a sense of humour and scottish antecedents

and monique delacroix from the canton of vaud switzerland <sos> [ 11 ] fleming did not provide bond ' s date of birth but john pearson ' s fictional biography of bond james bond : the authorized

beretta 418 [ 161 ] until he received a letter from a thirty one year old bond enthusiast and gun expert geoffrey boothroyd criticising fleming ' s choice of firearm for bond [ 162 ] calling it "" a lady ' s gun – and not a very nice lady at that <sos> "" [ 163 ] boothroyd suggested that bond should swap his beretta for a walther ppk 765mm and this exchange of arms made it to dr <sos> no <sos> [ 164 ] boothroyd also gave fleming advice on the berns martin triple draw shoulder holster and a number of the weapons used by smersh and other villains <sos> [ 165 ] in thanks fleming gave the mi6 armourer in his novels the name major boothroyd and in dr no m introduces him to bond as "" the greatest small arms expert in the world "" <sos> [ 164 ] bond also used a variety of rifles including the savage model 99 in "" for your eyes only "" and a winchester 308 target rifle in "" the living daylights "" <sos> [ 161 ] other handguns used by bond in the fleming books included the colt detective special and a long barrelled colt 45 army special [ 161 ] <sos> the first bond film dr no saw m ordering bond to leave his beretta behind and take up the walther ppk [ 166 ] which the film bond used in eighteen films <sos> [ 167 ] in tomorrow never dies and the two subsequent films bond ' s main weapon was the walther p99 semi automatic pistol [ 167 ] <sos> an aston martin db5 as seen in goldfinger vehicles <sos> in the early bond stories fleming gave bond a battleship grey bentley 4½ litre with an amherst villiers supercharger <sos> [ 168 ] after bond ' s car was written off by hugo drax in moonraker fleming gave bond a mark ii continental bentley which he used in the remaining books of the series <sos> [ 169 ] during goldfinger bond was issued with an aston martin db mark iii with a homing device which he used to track goldfinger across france <sos> bond returned to his bentley for the subsequent novels [ 169 ] <sos> the bond of the films has driven a number of cars including the aston martin v8 vantage [ 170 ] during the 1980s the v12 vanquish [ 170 ] and dbs [ 171 ] during the 2000s as well as the lotus esprit ; [ 172 ] the bmw z3 [ 173 ] bmw 750il [ 173 ] and the bmw z8 <sos> [ 173 ] he has however also needed to drive a number of other vehicles ranging from a citroën 2cv to a routemaster bus amongst others [ 174 ] <sos> bond ' s most famous car is the silver grey aston martin db5 first seen in goldfinger ; [ 175 ] it later featured in thunderball goldeneye tomorrow never dies casino royale skyfall and spectre <sos> [ 176 ] [ 177 ] the films have used a number of different aston martins for filming and publicity one of which was sold in january 2006 at an auction in the us for $2090000 to an unnamed european collector [ 178 ] <sos> gadgets <sos> the little nellie autogyro with its creator and pilot ken wallis <sos> fleming ' s novels and early screen adaptations presented minimal equipment such as the booby trapped attaché case in from russia with love although this situation changed dramatically with the films <sos> [ 179 ] however the effects of the two eon produced bond films dr no and from russia with love had an effect on the novel the man with the golden gun through the increased number of devices used in fleming ' s final story [ 180 ] <sos> for the film adaptations of bond the pre mission briefing by q branch became one of the motifs that ran through the series <sos> [ 181 ] dr no provided no spy related gadgets but a geiger counter was used ; industrial designer andy davey observed that the first ever onscreen spy gadget was the attaché case shown in from russia with love which he described as "" a classic 007 product "" <sos> [ 182 ] the gadgets assumed a higher profile in the 1964 film goldfinger <sos> the film ' s success encouraged further espionage equipment from q branch to be supplied to bond although the increased use of technology led to an accusation that bond was over reliant on equipment particularly in the later films [ 183 ] <sos> "" if it hadn ' t been for q branch you ' d have been dead long ago "" <sos> —q to bond licence to kill <sos> davey noted that "" bond ' s gizmos follow the zeitgeist more closely than any other nuance in the films "" [ 182 ] as they moved from the potential representations of the future in the early films through to the brand name obsessions of the later films <sos> [ 182 ] it is also noticeable that although bond uses a number of pieces of equipment from q branch including the little nellie autogyro [ 184 ] a jet pack [ 185 ] and the exploding attaché case [ 186 ] the villains are also well equipped with custom made devices [ 182 ] including scaramanga ' s golden gun [ 187 ] rosa klebb ' s poison tipped shoes [ 188 ] oddjob ' s steel rimmed bowler hat [ 189 ] and blofeld ' s communication devices in his agents ' vanity case [ 182 ] <sos> cultural impact <sos> see also : list of james bond parodies and spin offs <sos> fleming ' s bond novels <sos> james bond island ( khao phing kan thailand ) <sos> cinematically bond has been a major influence within the spy genre since the release of dr no in 1962 [ 190 ] with 22 secret agent films released in 1966 alone attempting to capitalise on the bond franchise ' s popularity and success <sos> [ 191 ] the first parody was the 1964 film carry on spying which shows the villain dr crow being overcome by agents who included james bind ( charles hawtry ) and daphne honeybutt ( barbara windsor ) <sos> [ 192 ] one of the films that reacted against the portrayal of bond was the harry palmer series whose first film the ipcress file was released in 1965 <sos> the eponymous hero of the series was what academic jeremy packer called an "" anti bond "" [ 193 ] or what christoph lindner calls "" the thinking man ' s bond "" <sos> [ 194 ] the palmer series were produced by harry saltzman who also used key crew members from the bond series including designer ken adam editor peter r hunt and composer john barry <sos> [ 195 ] the four "" matt helm "" films starring dean martin ( released between 1966 and 1969 ) [ 196 ] the "" flint "" series starring james coburn ( comprising two films one each in 1966 and 1969 ) [ 197 ] while the man from uncle <sos> also moved onto the cinema screen with eight films released : all were testaments to bond ' s prominence in popular culture <sos> [ 132 ] more recently the austin powers series by writer producer and comedian mike myers [ 198 ] and other parodies such as the 2003 film johnny english [ 199 ] have also used elements from or parodied the bond films <sos> following the release of the film dr no in 1962 the line "" bond james bond "" became a catch phrase that entered the lexicon of western popular culture : writers cork and scivally said of the introduction in dr no that the "" signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever "" <sos> [ 200 ] in 2001 it was voted as the "" best loved one liner in cinema "" by british cinema goers [ 201 ] and in 2005 it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the american film institute as part of their 100 years series <sos> [ 202 ] the 2005 american film institute ' s ' 100 years ' series recognised the character of james bond himself as the third greatest film hero <sos> [ 203 ] he was also placed at number 11 on a similar list by empire [ 204 ] and as the fifth greatest movie character of all time by premiere [ 205 ] <sos> the 23 james bond films produced by eon productions which have grossed $4910000000 in box office returns alone [ 206 ] have made the series one of the highest grossing ever <sos> it is estimated that since dr no a quarter of the world ' s population have seen at least one bond film <sos> [ 207 ] the uk film distributors ' association have stated that the importance of the bond series of films to the british film industry cannot be overstated as they "" form the backbone of the industry "" [ 208 ] <sos> television also saw the effect of bond films with the nbc series the man from uncle [ 209 ] which was described as the "" first network television imitation "" of bond [ 210 ] largely because fleming provided advice and ideas on the development of the series even giving the main character the name napoleon solo <sos> [ 211 ] other 1960s television series inspired by bond include i spy [ 197 ] and get smart [ 212 ] <sos> a british cultural icon by 2012 james bond had become such a symbol of the united kingdom that the character played by craig appeared in the opening ceremony of the 2012 london olympics as queen elizabeth ii ' s escort [ 213 ] [ 214 ] <sos> throughout the life of the film series a number of tie in products have been released [ 215 ] <sos> criticisms of james bond <sos> the james bond character and related media have triggered a number of criticisms and reactions across the political spectrum and are still highly debated in popular culture studies <sos> [ 216 ] [ 217 ] some observers accuse bond novels and films of misogyny and sexism <sos> [ 218 ] geographers have considered the role of exotic locations in the movies in the dynamics of the cold war with power struggles among blocs playing out in the peripheral areas <sos> [ 219 ] other critics claim that 21st century bond movies reflect imperial nostalgia <sos> [ 220 ] american conservative critics particularly in the 1960s and 1970s saw bond as a nihilistic hedonistic and amoral character that challenged family values [ 221 ] <sos> see also <sos> james bond portal <sos> main article :

of james bond as the central figure for his works <sos> bond is an intelligence officer in the secret intelligence service commonly known as mi6 <sos> bond is known by his code number 007 and was a royal naval reserve commander <sos> fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the naval intelligence division during the second world war admitting that bond "" was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types i met during the war "" <sos> [ 2 ] among those types were his brother peter who had been involved in behind the lines operations in norway and greece during the war <sos> [ 3 ] aside from fleming ' s brother a number of others also provided some aspects of bond ' s make up including conrad o ' brien ffrench patrick dalzel job and bill "" biffy "" dunderdale [ 2 ] <sos> the name james bond came from that of the american ornithologist james bond a caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide birds of the west indies <sos> fleming a keen birdwatcher himself had a copy of bond ' s guide and he later explained to the ornithologist ' s wife that "" it struck me that this brief unromantic anglo saxon and yet very masculine name was just what i needed and so a second james bond was born "" <sos> [ 4 ] he further explained that : <sos> when i wrote the first one in 1953 i wanted bond to be an extremely dull uninteresting man to whom things happened ; i wanted him to be a blunt instrument when i was casting around for a name for my protagonist i thought by god [ james bond ] is the dullest name i ever heard — ian fleming the new yorker 21 april 1962 [ 5 ] <sos> on another occasion fleming said : "" i wanted the simplest dullest plainest sounding name i could find ' james bond ' was much better than something more interesting like ' peregrine carruthers ' <sos> exotic things would happen to and around him but he would be a neutral figure—an anonymous blunt instrument wielded by a government department "" [ 6 ] <sos> hoagy carmichael—fleming ' s view of james bond <sos> fleming decided that bond should resemble both american singer hoagy carmichael and himself [ 7 ] and in casino royale vesper lynd remarks "" bond reminds me rather of hoagy carmichael but there is something cold and ruthless "" <sos> likewise in moonraker special branch officer gala brand thinks that bond is "" certainly good looking rather like hoagy carmichael in a way <sos> that black hair falling down over the right eyebrow <sos> much the same bones <sos> but there was something a bit cruel in the mouth and the eyes were cold "" [ 7 ] <sos> fleming endowed bond with many of his own traits including sharing the same golf handicap the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries <sos> [ 8 ] bond ' s tastes are also often taken from fleming ' s own as was his behaviour [ 9 ] with bond ' s love of golf and gambling mirroring fleming ' s own <sos> fleming used his experiences of his espionage career and all other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing including using names of school friends acquaintances relatives and lovers throughout his books [ 2 ] <sos> it was not until the penultimate novel you only live twice that fleming gave bond a sense of family background <sos> the book was the first to be written after the release of dr no in cinemas and sean connery ' s depiction of bond affected fleming ' s interpretation of the character to give bond both a sense of humour and scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories <sos> [ 10 ] in a fictional obituary purportedly published in the times bond ' s parents were given as andrew bond from the village of glencoe scotland and monique delacroix from the canton of vaud switzerland <sos> [ 11 ] fleming did not provide bond ' s date of birth but john pearson ' s fictional biography of bond james bond : the authorized biography of 007 gives bond a birth date on 11

described by another bond film composer david arnold as "" bebop swing vibe coupled with that vicious dark distorted electric guitar definitely an instrument of rock ' n ' roll it represented everything about the character you would want : it was cocky swaggering confident dark dangerous suggestive sexy unstoppable <sos> and he did it in two minutes <sos> "" [ 131 ] barry composed the scores for eleven bond films [ 132 ] and had an uncredited contribution to dr no with his arrangement of the bond theme [ 131 ] <sos> a bond film staple are the theme songs heard during their title sequences sung by well known popular singers <sos> [ 133 ] several of the songs produced for the films have been nominated for academy awards for original song including paul mccartney ' s "" live and

beretta 418 [ 161 ] until he received a letter from a thirty one year old bond enthusiast and gun expert geoffrey boothroyd criticising fleming ' s choice of firearm for bond [ 162 ] calling it "" a lady ' s gun – and not a very nice lady at that <sos> "" [ 163 ] boothroyd suggested that bond should swap his beretta for a walther ppk 765mm and this exchange of arms made it to dr <sos> no <sos> [ 164 ] boothroyd also gave fleming advice on the berns martin triple draw shoulder holster and a number of the weapons used by smersh and other villains <sos> [ 165 ] in thanks fleming gave the mi6 armourer in his novels the name major boothroyd and in dr no m introduces him to bond as "" the greatest small arms expert in the world "" <sos> [ 164 ] bond also used a variety of rifles including the savage model 99 in "" for your eyes only "" and a winchester 308 target rifle in "" the living daylights "" <sos> [ 161 ] other handguns used by bond in the fleming books included the colt detective special and a long barrelled colt 45 army special [ 161 ] <sos> the first bond film dr no saw m ordering bond to leave his beretta behind and take up the walther ppk [ 166 ] which the film bond used in eighteen films <sos> [ 167 ] in tomorrow never dies and the two subsequent films bond ' s main weapon was the walther p99 semi automatic pistol [ 167 ] <sos> an aston martin db5 as seen in goldfinger vehicles <sos> in the early bond stories fleming gave bond a battleship grey bentley 4½ litre with an amherst villiers supercharger <sos> [ 168 ] after bond ' s car was written off by hugo drax in moonraker fleming gave bond a mark ii continental bentley which he used in the remaining books of the series <sos> [ 169 ] during goldfinger bond was issued with an aston martin db mark iii with a homing device which he used to track goldfinger across france <sos> bond returned to his bentley for the subsequent novels [ 169 ] <sos> the bond of the films has driven a number of cars including the aston martin v8 vantage [ 170 ] during the 1980s the v12 vanquish [ 170 ] and dbs [ 171 ] during the 2000s as well as the lotus esprit ; [ 172 ] the bmw z3 [ 173 ] bmw 750il [ 173 ] and the bmw z8 <sos> [ 173 ] he has however also needed to drive a number of other vehicles ranging from a citroën 2cv to a routemaster bus amongst others [ 174 ] <sos> bond ' s most famous car is the silver grey aston martin db5 first seen in goldfinger ; [ 175 ] it later featured in thunderball goldeneye tomorrow never dies casino royale skyfall and spectre <sos> [ 176 ] [ 177 ] the films have used a number of different aston martins for filming and publicity one of which was sold in january 2006 at an auction in the us for $2090000 to an unnamed european collector [ 178 ] <sos> gadgets <sos> the little nellie autogyro with its creator and pilot ken wallis <sos> fleming ' s novels and early screen adaptations presented minimal equipment such as the booby trapped attaché case in from russia with love although this situation changed dramatically with the films <sos> [ 179 ] however the effects of the two eon produced bond films dr no and from russia with love had an effect on the novel the man with the golden gun through the increased number of devices used in fleming ' s final story [ 180 ] <sos> for the film adaptations of bond the pre mission briefing by q branch became one of the motifs that ran through the series <sos> [ 181 ] dr no provided no spy related gadgets but a geiger counter was used ; industrial designer andy davey observed that the first ever onscreen spy gadget was the attaché case shown in from russia with love which he described as "" a classic 007 product "" <sos> [ 182 ] the gadgets assumed a higher profile in the 1964 film goldfinger <sos> the film ' s success encouraged further espionage equipment from q branch to be supplied to bond although the increased use of technology led to an accusation that bond was over reliant on equipment particularly in the later films [ 183 ] <sos> "" if it hadn ' t been for q branch you ' d have been dead long ago "" <sos> —q to bond licence to kill <sos> davey noted that "" bond ' s gizmos follow the zeitgeist more closely than any other nuance in the films "" [ 182 ] as they moved from the potential representations of the future in the early films through to the brand name obsessions of the later films <sos> [ 182 ] it is also noticeable that although bond uses a number of pieces of equipment from q branch including the little nellie autogyro [ 184 ] a jet pack [ 185 ] and the exploding attaché case [ 186 ] the villains are also well equipped with custom made devices [ 182 ] including scaramanga ' s golden gun [ 187 ] rosa klebb ' s poison tipped shoes [ 188 ] oddjob ' s steel rimmed bowler hat [ 189 ] and blofeld ' s communication devices in his agents ' vanity case [ 182 ] <sos> cultural impact <sos> see also : list of james bond parodies and spin offs <sos> fleming ' s bond novels <sos> james bond island ( khao phing kan thailand ) <sos> cinematically bond has been a major influence within the spy genre since the release of dr no in 1962 [ 190 ] with 22 secret agent films released in 1966 alone attempting to capitalise on the bond franchise ' s popularity and success <sos> [ 191 ] the first parody was the 1964 film carry on spying which shows the villain dr crow being overcome by agents who included james bind ( charles hawtry ) and daphne honeybutt ( barbara windsor ) <sos> [ 192 ] one of the films that reacted against the portrayal of bond was the harry palmer series whose first film the ipcress file was released in 1965 <sos> the eponymous hero of the series was what academic jeremy packer called an "" anti bond "" [ 193 ] or what christoph lindner calls "" the thinking man ' s bond "" <sos> [ 194 ] the palmer series were produced by harry saltzman who also used key crew members from the bond series including designer ken adam editor peter r hunt and composer john barry <sos> [ 195 ] the four "" matt helm "" films starring dean martin ( released between 1966 and 1969 ) [ 196 ] the "" flint "" series starring james coburn ( comprising two films one each in 1966 and 1969 ) [ 197 ] while the man from uncle <sos> also moved onto the cinema screen with eight films released : all were testaments to bond ' s prominence in popular culture <sos> [ 132 ] more recently the austin powers series by writer producer and comedian mike myers [ 198 ] and other parodies such as the 2003 film johnny english [ 199 ] have also used elements from or parodied the bond films <sos> following the release of the film dr no in 1962 the line "" bond james bond "" became a catch phrase that entered the lexicon of western popular culture : writers cork and scivally said of the introduction in dr no that the "" signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever "" <sos> [ 200 ] in 2001 it was voted as the "" best loved one liner in cinema "" by british cinema goers [ 201 ] and in 2005 it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the american film institute as part of their 100 years series <sos> [ 202 ] the 2005 american film institute ' s ' 100 years ' series recognised the character of james bond himself as the third greatest film hero <sos> [ 203 ] he was also placed at number 11 on a similar list by empire [ 204 ] and as the fifth greatest movie character of all time by premiere [ 205 ] <sos> the 23 james bond films produced by eon productions which have grossed $4910000000 in box office returns alone [ 206 ] have made the series one of the highest grossing ever <sos> it is estimated that since dr no a quarter of the world ' s population have seen at least one bond film <sos> [ 207 ] the uk film distributors ' association have stated that the importance of the bond series of films to the british film industry cannot be overstated as they "" form the backbone of the industry "" [ 208 ] <sos> television also saw the effect of bond films with the nbc series the man from uncle [ 209 ] which was described as the "" first network television imitation "" of bond [ 210 ] largely because fleming provided advice and ideas on the development of the series even giving the main character the name napoleon solo <sos> [ 211 ] other 1960s television series inspired by bond include i spy [ 197 ] and get smart [ 212 ] <sos> a british cultural icon by 2012 james bond had become such a symbol of the united kingdom that the character played by craig appeared in the opening ceremony of the 2012 london olympics as queen elizabeth ii ' s escort [ 213 ] [ 214 ] <sos> throughout the life of the film series a number of tie in products have been released [ 215 ] <sos> criticisms of james bond <sos> the james bond character and related media have triggered a number of criticisms and reactions across the political spectrum and are still highly debated in popular culture studies <sos> [ 216 ] [ 217 ] some observers accuse bond novels and films of misogyny and sexism <sos> [ 218 ] geographers have considered the role of exotic locations in the movies in the dynamics of the cold war with power struggles among blocs playing out in the peripheral areas <sos> [ 219 ] other critics claim that 21st century bond movies reflect imperial nostalgia <sos> [ 220 ] american conservative critics particularly in the 1960s and 1970s saw bond as a nihilistic hedonistic and amoral character that challenged family values [ 221 ] <sos> see also <sos> james bond portal <sos> main article :

of james bond as the central figure for his works <sos> bond is an intelligence officer in the secret intelligence service commonly known as mi6 <sos> bond is known by his code number 007 and was a royal naval reserve commander <sos> fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the naval intelligence division during the second world war admitting that bond "" was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types i met during the war "" <sos> [ 2 ] among those types were his brother peter who had been involved in behind the lines operations in norway and greece during the war <sos> [ 3 ] aside from fleming ' s brother a number of others also provided some aspects of bond ' s make up including conrad o ' brien ffrench patrick dalzel job and bill "" biffy "" dunderdale [ 2 ] <sos> the name james bond came from that of the american ornithologist james bond a caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide birds of the west indies <sos> fleming a keen birdwatcher himself had a copy of bond ' s guide and he later explained to the ornithologist ' s wife that "" it struck me that this brief unromantic anglo saxon and yet very masculine name was just what i needed and so a second james bond was born "" <sos> [ 4 ] he further explained that : <sos> when i wrote the first one in 1953 i wanted bond to be an extremely dull uninteresting man to whom things happened ; i wanted him to be a blunt instrument when i was casting around for a name for my protagonist i thought by god [ james bond ] is the dullest name i ever heard — ian fleming the new yorker 21 april 1962 [ 5 ] <sos> on another occasion fleming said : "" i wanted the simplest dullest plainest sounding name i could find ' james bond ' was much better than something more interesting like ' peregrine carruthers ' <sos> exotic things would happen to and around him but he would be a neutral figure—an anonymous blunt instrument wielded by a government department "" [ 6 ] <sos> hoagy carmichael—fleming ' s view of james bond <sos> fleming decided that bond should resemble both american singer hoagy carmichael and himself [ 7 ] and in casino royale vesper lynd remarks "" bond reminds me rather of hoagy carmichael but there is something cold and ruthless "" <sos> likewise in moonraker special branch officer gala brand thinks that bond is "" certainly good looking rather like hoagy carmichael in a way <sos> that black hair falling down over the right eyebrow <sos> much the same bones <sos> but there was something a bit cruel in the mouth and the eyes were cold "" [ 7 ] <sos> fleming endowed bond with many of his own traits including sharing the same golf handicap the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries <sos> [ 8 ] bond ' s tastes are also often taken from fleming ' s own as was his behaviour [ 9 ] with bond ' s love of golf and gambling mirroring fleming ' s own <sos> fleming used his experiences of his espionage career and all other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing including using names of school friends acquaintances relatives and lovers throughout his books [ 2 ] <sos> it was not until the penultimate novel you only live twice that fleming gave bond a sense of family background <sos> the book was the first to be written after the release of dr no in cinemas and sean connery ' s depiction of bond affected fleming ' s interpretation of the character to give bond both a sense of humour and scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories <sos> [ 10 ] in a fictional obituary purportedly published in the times bond ' s parents were given as andrew bond from the village of glencoe scotland and monique delacroix from the canton of vaud switzerland <sos> [ 11 ] fleming did not provide bond ' s date of birth but john pearson ' s fictional biography of bond james bond : the authorized biography of 007 gives bond a birth date on 11 november 1920 [ 12 ] while a study by john griswold puts the date at 11 november 1921 [ 13 ] <sos> novels and related works <sos> main article : list of james bond novels and short stories <sos> ian

lady ' s gun – and not a very nice lady at that <sos> "" [ 163 ] boothroyd suggested that bond should swap his beretta for a walther ppk 765mm and this exchange of arms made it to dr <sos> no <sos> [ 164 ] boothroyd also gave fleming advice on the berns martin triple draw shoulder holster and a number of the weapons used by smersh and other villains <sos> [ 165 ] in thanks fleming gave the mi6 armourer in his novels the name major boothroyd and in dr no m introduces him to bond as "" the greatest small arms expert in the world "" <sos> [ 164 ] bond also used a variety of rifles including the savage model 99 in "" for your eyes only "" and a winchester 308 target rifle in "" the living daylights "" <sos> [ 161 ] other handguns used by bond in the fleming books included the colt detective special and a long barrelled colt 45 army special [ 161 ] <sos> the first bond film dr no saw m ordering bond to leave his beretta behind and take up the walther ppk [ 166 ] which the film bond used in eighteen films <sos> [ 167 ] in tomorrow never dies and the two subsequent films bond ' s main weapon was the walther p99 semi automatic pistol [ 167 ] <sos> an aston martin db5 as seen in goldfinger vehicles <sos> in the early bond stories fleming gave bond a battleship grey bentley 4½ litre with an amherst villiers supercharger <sos> [ 168 ] after bond ' s car was written off by hugo drax in moonraker fleming gave bond a mark ii continental bentley which he used in the remaining books of the series <sos> [ 169 ] during goldfinger bond was issued with an aston martin db mark iii with a homing device which he used to track goldfinger across france <sos> bond returned to his bentley for the subsequent novels [ 169 ] <sos> the bond of the films has driven a number of cars including the aston martin v8 vantage [ 170 ] during the 1980s the v12 vanquish [ 170 ] and dbs [ 171 ] during the 2000s as well as the lotus esprit ; [ 172 ] the bmw z3 [ 173 ] bmw 750il [ 173 ] and

used a number of different aston martins for filming and publicity one of which was sold in january 2006 at an auction in the us for $2090000 to an unnamed european collector [ 178 ] <sos> gadgets <sos> the little nellie autogyro with its creator and pilot ken wallis <sos> fleming ' s novels and early screen adaptations presented minimal equipment such as the booby trapped attaché case in from russia with love although this situation changed dramatically with the films <sos> [ 179 ] however the effects of the two eon produced bond films dr no and from russia with love had an effect on the novel the man with the golden gun through the increased number of devices used in fleming ' s final story [ 180 ] <sos> for the film adaptations of bond the pre mission briefing by q branch became one of the motifs that ran through the series <sos> [ 181 ] dr no provided no spy related gadgets but a geiger counter was used ; industrial designer andy davey observed that the first ever onscreen spy gadget was the attaché case shown in from russia with love which he described as "" a classic 007 product "" <sos> [ 182 ] the gadgets assumed a higher profile in the 1964 film goldfinger <sos> the film ' s success encouraged further espionage equipment from q branch to be supplied to bond although the increased use of technology led to an accusation that bond was over reliant on equipment particularly in the later films [ 183 ] <sos> "" if it hadn ' t been for q branch you ' d have been dead long ago "" <sos> —q to bond licence to kill <sos> davey noted that "" bond ' s gizmos follow the zeitgeist more closely than any other nuance in the films "" [ 182 ] as they moved from the potential representations of the future in the early films through to the brand name obsessions of the later films <sos> [ 182 ] it is also noticeable that although bond uses a number of pieces of equipment from q branch including the little nellie autogyro [ 184 ] a jet pack [ 185 ] and the exploding attaché case [ 186 ] the villains are also well equipped with custom made devices [ 182 ] including scaramanga ' s golden gun [ 187 ] rosa klebb ' s poison tipped shoes [ 188 ] oddjob ' s steel rimmed bowler hat [ 189 ] and blofeld ' s communication devices in his agents ' vanity case [ 182 ] <sos> cultural impact <sos> see also : list of james bond parodies and spin offs <sos> fleming ' s bond novels <sos> james bond island ( khao phing kan thailand ) <sos> cinematically bond has been a major influence within the spy genre since the release of dr no in 1962 [ 190 ] with 22 secret agent films released in 1966 alone attempting to capitalise on the bond franchise ' s popularity and success <sos> [ 191 ] the first parody was the 1964 film carry on spying which shows the villain dr crow being overcome by agents who included james bind ( charles hawtry ) and daphne honeybutt ( barbara windsor ) <sos> [ 192 ] one of the films that reacted against the portrayal of bond was the harry palmer series whose first film the ipcress file was released in 1965 <sos> the eponymous hero of the series was what academic jeremy packer called an "" anti bond "" [ 193 ] or what christoph lindner calls "" the thinking man ' s bond "" <sos> [ 194 ] the palmer series were produced by harry saltzman who also used key crew members from the bond series including designer ken adam editor peter r hunt and composer john barry <sos> [ 195 ] the four "" matt helm "" films starring dean martin ( released between 1966 and 1969 ) [ 196 ] the "" flint "" series starring james coburn ( comprising two films one each in 1966 and 1969 ) [ 197 ] while the man from uncle <sos> also moved onto the cinema screen with eight films released : all were testaments to bond ' s prominence in popular culture <sos> [ 132 ] more recently the austin powers series by writer producer and comedian mike myers [ 198 ] and other parodies such as the 2003 film johnny english [ 199 ] have also used elements from or parodied the bond films <sos> following the release of the film dr no in 1962 the line "" bond james bond "" became a catch phrase that entered the lexicon of western popular culture : writers cork and scivally said of the introduction in dr no that the "" signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever "" <sos> [ 200 ] in 2001 it was voted as the "" best loved one liner in cinema "" by british cinema goers [ 201 ] and in 2005 it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the american film institute as part of their 100 years series <sos> [ 202 ] the 2005 american film institute ' s ' 100 years ' series recognised the character of james bond himself as the third greatest film hero <sos> [ 203 ] he was also placed at number 11 on a similar list by empire [ 204 ] and as the fifth greatest movie character of all time by premiere [ 205 ] <sos> the 23 james bond films produced by eon productions which have grossed $4910000000 in box office returns alone [ 206 ] have made the series one of the highest grossing ever <sos> it is estimated that since dr no a quarter of the world ' s population have seen at least one bond film <sos> [ 207 ] the uk film distributors ' association have stated that the importance of the bond series of films to the british film industry cannot be overstated as they "" form the backbone of the industry "" [ 208 ] <sos> television also saw the effect of bond films with the nbc series the man from uncle [ 209 ] which was described as the "" first network television imitation "" of bond [ 210 ] largely because fleming provided advice and ideas on the development of the series even giving the main character the name napoleon solo <sos> [ 211 ] other 1960s television series inspired by bond include i spy [ 197 ] and get smart [ 212 ] <sos> a british cultural icon by 2012 james bond had become such a symbol of the united kingdom that the character played by craig appeared in the opening ceremony of the 2012 london olympics as queen elizabeth ii ' s escort [ 213 ] [ 214 ] <sos> throughout the life of the film series a number of tie in products have been released [ 215 ] <sos> criticisms of james bond <sos> the james bond character and related media have triggered a number of criticisms and reactions across the political spectrum and are still highly debated in popular culture studies <sos> [ 216 ] [ 217 ] some observers accuse bond novels and films of misogyny and sexism <sos> [ 218 ] geographers have considered the role of exotic locations in the movies in the dynamics of the cold war with power struggles among blocs playing out in the peripheral areas <sos> [ 219 ] other critics claim that 21st century bond movies reflect imperial nostalgia <sos> [ 220 ] american conservative critics particularly in the 1960s and 1970s saw bond as a nihilistic hedonistic and amoral character that challenged family values [ 221 ] <sos> see also <sos> james bond portal <sos> main article :

physicist galileo galilei is usually credited with being the first to measure speed by considering the distance covered and the time it takes <sos> galileo defined speed as the distance covered per unit of time <sos> [ 3 ] in equation form this is <sos> v = <sos> d t <sos> {\displaystyle v={\frac {d}{t}}} <sos> where <sos> v {\displaystyle v} <sos> is speed <sos> d {\displaystyle d} <sos> is distance and <sos> t {\displaystyle t} <sos> is time <sos> a cyclist who covers 30 metres in a time of 2 seconds for example has a speed of 15 metres per second <sos> objects in motion often have variations in speed ( a car might travel along a street at 50 km/h slow to 0 km/h and then reach 30 km/h ) instantaneous speed [ edit ] <sos> speed at some instant or assumed constant during a very short period of time is called instantaneous speed <sos> by looking at a speedometer one can read the instantaneous speed of a car at any instant <sos> [ 3 ] a car travelling at 50 km/h generally goes for less than one hour at a constant speed but if it did go at that speed for a full hour it would travel 50 km <sos> if the vehicle continued at that speed for half an hour it would cover half that distance ( 25 km ) <sos> if it continued for only one minute it would cover about 833 m <sos> in mathematical terms the instantaneous speed <sos> v {\displaystyle v} <sos> is defined as the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity <sos> v {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {v}}} <sos> that is the derivative of the position <sos> r {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {r}}} <sos> with respect to time : [ 2 ] [ 4 ] <sos> v = <sos> | <sos> v | <sos> = <sos> | <sos> r ˙ <sos> | <sos> = <sos> | <sos> d r d t | <sos> {\displaystyle v=\left|{\boldsymbol {v}}\right|=\left|{\dot {\boldsymbol {r}}}\right|=\left|{\frac {d{\boldsymbol {r}}}{dt}}\right|\} <sos> if <sos> s {\displaystyle s} <sos> is the length of the path ( also known as the distance ) travelled until time <sos> t {\displaystyle t} <sos> the speed equals the time derivative of <sos> s {\displaystyle s} <sos> : [ 2 ] <sos> v = <sos> d s d t {\displaystyle v={\frac {ds}{dt}}} <sos> in the special case where the velocity is constant ( that is constant speed in a straight line ) this can be simplified to <sos> v = <sos> s / <sos> t {\displaystyle v=s/t} <sos> <sos> the average speed over a finite time interval is the total distance travelled divided by the time duration average speed [ edit ] <sos> different from instantaneous speed average speed is defined as the total distance covered divided by the time interval <sos> for example if a distance of 80 kilometres is driven in 1 hour the average speed is 80 kilometres per hour <sos> likewise if 320 kilometres are travelled in 4 hours the average speed is also 80 kilometres per hour <sos> when a distance in kilometres ( km ) is divided by a time in hours ( h ) the result is in kilometres per hour ( km/h ) <sos> average speed does not describe the speed variations that may have taken place during shorter time intervals ( as it is the entire distance covered divided by the total time of travel ) and so average speed is often quite different from a value of instantaneous speed <sos> [ 3 ] if the average speed and the time of travel are known the distance travelled can be calculated by rearranging the definition to <sos> d = <sos> v ¯ <sos> t {\displaystyle d={\boldsymbol {\bar {v}}}t\} <sos> using this equation for an average speed of 80 kilometres per hour on a 4 hour trip the distance covered is found to be 320 kilometres <sos> expressed in graphical language the slope of a tangent line at any point of a distance time graph is the instantaneous speed at this point while the slope of a chord line of the same graph is the average speed during the time interval covered by the chord tangential speed [ edit ] <sos> linear speed is the distance travelled per unit of time while tangential speed ( or tangential velocity ) is the linear speed of something moving along a circular path <sos> [ 5 ] a point on the outside edge of a merry go round or turntable travels a greater distance in one complete rotation than a point nearer the center <sos> travelling a greater distance in the same time means a greater speed and so linear speed is greater on the outer edge of a rotating object than it is closer to the axis <sos> this speed along a circular path is known as tangential speed because the direction of motion is tangent to the circumference of the circle <sos> for circular motion the terms linear speed and tangential speed are used interchangeably and both use units of m/s km/h and others <sos> rotational speed ( or angular speed ) involves the number of revolutions per unit of time <sos> all parts of a rigid merry go round or turntable turn about the axis of rotation in the same amount of time <sos> thus all parts share the same rate of rotation or the same number of rotations or revolutions per unit of time <sos> it is common to express rotational rates in revolutions per minute ( rpm ) or in terms of the number of "" radians "" turned in a unit of time <sos> there are little more than 6 radians in a full rotation ( 2π radians exactly ) <sos> when a direction is assigned to rotational speed it is known as rotational velocity or angular velocity <sos> rotational velocity is a vector whose magnitude is the rotational speed tangential speed and rotational speed are related : the greater the rpms the larger the speed in metres per second <sos> tangential speed is directly proportional to rotational speed at any fixed distance from the axis of rotation <sos> [ 5 ] however tangential speed unlike rotational speed depends on radial distance ( the distance from the axis ) <sos> for a platform rotating with a fixed rotational speed the tangential speed in the centre is zero <sos> towards the edge of the platform the tangential speed increases proportional to the distance from the axis <sos> [ 6 ] in equation form : <sos> v ∝ <sos> r ω <sos> {\displaystyle v\propto \\r\omega \} <sos> where v is tangential speed and ω ( greek letter omega ) is rotational speed <sos> one moves faster if the rate of rotation increases ( a larger value for ω ) and one also moves faster if movement farther from the axis occurs ( a larger value for r ) <sos> move twice as far from the rotational axis at the centre and you move twice as fast <sos> move out three times as far and you have three times as much tangential speed <sos> in any kind of rotating system tangential speed depends on how far you are from the axis of rotation <sos> when proper units are used for tangential speed v rotational speed ω and radial distance r the direct proportion of v to both r and ω becomes the exact equation <sos> v = <sos> r ω <sos> {\displaystyle v=r\omega \} <sos> thus tangential speed will be directly proportional to r when all parts of a system simultaneously have the same ω as for a wheel disk or rigid wand units [ edit ] <sos> main article : conversion of units § speed or velocity <sos> units of speed include : <sos> metres per second ( symbol m s−1 or m/s ) the si

of change of its position ) ; it is thus a scalar quantity <sos> [ 1 ] the average speed of an object in an interval of time is the distance travelled by the object divided by the duration of the interval ; [ 2 ] the instantaneous speed is the limit of the average speed as the duration of the time interval approaches zero <sos> speed has the dimensions of distance divided by time <sos> the si unit of speed is the metre per second but the most common unit of speed in everyday usage is the kilometre per hour or in the us and the uk miles per hour <sos> for air and marine travel the knot is commonly used <sos> the fastest possible speed at which energy or information can travel according to special relativity is the speed of light in a vacuum c = 7008299792458000000♠299792458 metres per second ( approximately 7008299722222222222♠1079000000 km/h or 7008299963840000000♠671000000 mph ) <sos> matter cannot quite reach the speed of light as this would require an infinite amount of energy

<sos> italian physicist galileo galilei is usually credited with being the first to measure speed by considering the distance covered and the time it takes <sos> galileo defined speed as the distance covered per unit of time <sos> [ 3 ] in equation form this is <sos> v = <sos> d t <sos> {\displaystyle v={\frac {d}{t}}} <sos> where <sos> v {\displaystyle v} <sos> is speed <sos> d {\displaystyle d} <sos> is distance and <sos> t {\displaystyle t} <sos> is time <sos> a cyclist who covers 30 metres in a time of 2 seconds for example has a speed of 15 metres per second <sos> objects in motion often have variations in speed ( a car might travel along a street at 50 km/h slow to 0 km/h and then reach 30 km/h ) instantaneous speed [ edit ] <sos> speed at some instant or assumed constant during a very short period of time is called instantaneous speed <sos> by looking at a speedometer one can read the instantaneous speed of a car at any instant <sos> [ 3 ] a car travelling at 50 km/h generally goes for less than one hour at a constant speed but if it did go at that speed for a full hour it would travel 50 km <sos> if the vehicle continued at that speed for half an hour it would cover half that distance ( 25 km ) <sos> if it continued for only one minute it would cover about 833 m <sos> in mathematical terms the instantaneous speed <sos> v {\displaystyle v} <sos> is defined as the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity <sos> v {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {v}}} <sos> that is the derivative of the position <sos> r {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {r}}} <sos> with respect to time : [ 2 ] [ 4 ] <sos> v = <sos> | <sos> v | <sos> = <sos> | <sos> r ˙ <sos> | <sos> = <sos> | <sos> d r d t | <sos> {\displaystyle v=\left|{\boldsymbol {v}}\right|=\left|{\dot {\boldsymbol {r}}}\right|=\left|{\frac {d{\boldsymbol {r}}}{dt}}\right|\} <sos> if <sos> s {\displaystyle s} <sos> is the length of the path ( also known as the distance ) travelled until time <sos> t {\displaystyle t} <sos> the speed equals the time derivative of <sos> s {\displaystyle s} <sos> : [ 2 ] <sos> v = <sos> d s d t {\displaystyle v={\frac {ds}{dt}}} <sos> in the special case where the velocity is constant ( that is constant speed in a straight line ) this can be simplified to <sos> v = <sos> s / <sos> t {\displaystyle v=s/t} <sos> <sos> the average speed over a finite time interval is the total distance travelled divided by the time duration average speed [ edit ] <sos> different from instantaneous speed average speed is defined as the total distance covered divided by the time interval <sos> for example if a distance of 80 kilometres is driven in 1 hour the average speed is 80 kilometres per hour <sos> likewise if 320 kilometres are travelled in 4 hours the average speed is also 80 kilometres per hour <sos> when a distance in kilometres ( km ) is divided by a time in hours ( h ) the result is in kilometres per hour ( km/h ) <sos> average speed does not describe the speed variations that may have taken place during shorter time intervals ( as it is the entire distance covered divided by the total time of travel ) and so average speed is often quite different from a value of instantaneous speed <sos> [ 3 ] if the average speed and the time of travel are known the distance travelled can be calculated by rearranging the definition to <sos> d = <sos> v ¯ <sos> t {\displaystyle d={\boldsymbol {\bar {v}}}t\} <sos> using this equation for an average speed of 80 kilometres per hour on a 4 hour trip the distance covered is found to be 320 kilometres <sos> expressed in graphical language the slope of a tangent line at any point of a distance time graph is the instantaneous speed at this point while the slope of a chord line of the same graph is the average speed during the time interval covered by the chord tangential speed [ edit ] <sos> linear speed is the distance travelled per unit of time while tangential speed ( or tangential velocity ) is the linear speed of something moving along a circular path <sos> [ 5 ] a point on the outside edge of a merry go round or turntable travels a greater distance in one complete rotation than a point nearer the center <sos> travelling a greater distance in the same time means a greater speed and so linear speed is greater on the outer edge of a rotating object than it is closer to the axis <sos> this speed along a circular path is known as tangential speed because the direction of motion is tangent to the circumference of the circle <sos> for circular motion the terms linear speed and tangential speed are used interchangeably and both use units of m/s km/h and others <sos> rotational speed ( or angular speed ) involves the number of revolutions per unit of time <sos> all parts of a rigid merry go round or turntable turn about the axis of rotation in the same amount of time <sos> thus all parts share the same rate of rotation or the same number of rotations or revolutions per unit of time <sos> it is common to express rotational rates in revolutions per minute ( rpm ) or in terms of the number of "" radians "" turned in a unit of time <sos> there are little more than 6 radians in a full rotation ( 2π radians exactly ) <sos> when a direction is assigned to rotational speed it is known as rotational velocity or angular velocity <sos> rotational velocity is a vector whose magnitude is the rotational speed tangential speed and rotational speed are related : the greater the rpms the larger the speed in metres per second <sos> tangential speed is directly proportional to rotational speed at any fixed distance from the axis of rotation <sos> [ 5 ] however tangential speed unlike rotational speed depends on radial distance ( the distance from the axis ) <sos> for a platform rotating with a fixed rotational speed the tangential speed in the centre is zero <sos> towards the edge of the platform the tangential speed increases proportional to the distance from the axis <sos> [ 6 ] in equation form : <sos> v ∝ <sos> r ω <sos> {\displaystyle v\propto \\r\omega \} <sos> where v is tangential speed and ω ( greek letter omega ) is rotational speed <sos> one moves faster if the rate of rotation increases ( a larger value for ω ) and one also moves faster if movement farther from the axis occurs ( a larger value for r ) <sos> move twice as far from the rotational axis at the centre and you move twice as fast <sos> move out three times as far and you have three times as much tangential speed <sos> in any kind of rotating system tangential speed depends on how far you are from the axis of rotation <sos> when proper units are used for tangential speed v rotational speed ω and radial distance r the direct proportion of v to both r and ω becomes the exact equation <sos> v = <sos> r ω <sos> {\displaystyle v=r\omega \} <sos> thus tangential speed will be directly proportional to r when all parts of a system simultaneously have the same ω as for a wheel disk or rigid wand units [ edit ] <sos> main article : conversion of units § speed or velocity <sos> units of speed include : <sos> metres per second ( symbol m s−1 or m/s ) the si

of change of its position ) ; it is thus a scalar quantity <sos> [ 1 ] the average speed of an object in an interval of time is the distance travelled by the object divided by the duration of the interval ; [ 2 ] the instantaneous speed is the limit of the average speed as the duration of the time interval approaches zero <sos> speed has the dimensions of distance divided by time <sos> the si unit of speed is the metre per second but the most common unit of speed in everyday usage is the kilometre per hour or in the us and the uk miles per hour <sos> for air and marine travel the knot is commonly used <sos> the fastest possible speed at which energy or information can travel according to special relativity is the speed of light in a vacuum c = 7008299792458000000♠299792458 metres per second ( approximately 7008299722222222222♠1079000000 km/h or 7008299963840000000♠671000000 mph ) <sos> matter cannot quite reach the speed of light as this would require an infinite amount of energy

<sos> italian physicist galileo galilei is usually credited with being the first to measure speed by considering the distance covered and the time it takes <sos> galileo defined speed as the distance covered per unit of time <sos> [ 3 ] in equation form this is <sos> v = <sos> d t <sos> {\displaystyle v={\frac {d}{t}}} <sos> where <sos> v {\displaystyle v} <sos> is speed <sos> d {\displaystyle d} <sos> is distance and <sos> t {\displaystyle t} <sos> is time <sos> a cyclist who covers 30 metres in a time of 2 seconds for example has a speed of 15 metres per second <sos> objects in motion often have variations in speed ( a car might travel along a street at 50 km/h slow to 0 km/h and then reach 30 km/h ) instantaneous speed [ edit ] <sos> speed at some instant or assumed constant during a very short period of time is called instantaneous speed <sos> by looking at a speedometer one can read the instantaneous speed of a car at any instant <sos> [ 3 ] a car travelling at 50 km/h generally goes for less than one hour at a constant speed but if it did go at that speed for a full hour it would travel 50 km <sos> if the vehicle continued at that speed for half an hour it would cover half that distance ( 25 km ) <sos> if it continued for only one minute it would cover about 833 m <sos> in mathematical terms the instantaneous speed <sos> v {\displaystyle v} <sos> is defined as the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity <sos> v {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {v}}} <sos> that is the derivative of the position <sos> r {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {r}}} <sos> with respect to time : [ 2 ] [ 4 ] <sos> v = <sos> | <sos> v | <sos> = <sos> | <sos> r ˙ <sos> | <sos> = <sos> | <sos> d r d t | <sos> {\displaystyle v=\left|{\boldsymbol {v}}\right|=\left|{\dot {\boldsymbol {r}}}\right|=\left|{\frac {d{\boldsymbol {r}}}{dt}}\right|\} <sos> if <sos> s {\displaystyle s} <sos> is the length of the path ( also known as the distance ) travelled until time <sos> t {\displaystyle t} <sos> the speed equals the time derivative of <sos> s {\displaystyle s} <sos> : [ 2 ] <sos> v = <sos> d s d t {\displaystyle v={\frac {ds}{dt}}} <sos> in the special case where the velocity is constant ( that is constant speed in a straight line ) this can be simplified to <sos> v = <sos> s / <sos> t {\displaystyle v=s/t} <sos> <sos> the average speed over a finite time interval is the total distance travelled divided by the time duration average speed [ edit ] <sos> different from instantaneous speed average speed is defined as the total distance covered divided by the time interval <sos> for example if a distance of 80 kilometres is driven in 1 hour the average speed is 80 kilometres per hour <sos> likewise if 320 kilometres are travelled in 4 hours the average speed is also 80 kilometres per hour <sos> when a distance in kilometres ( km ) is divided by a time in hours ( h ) the result is in kilometres per hour ( km/h ) <sos> average speed does not describe the speed variations that may have taken place during shorter time intervals ( as it is the entire distance covered divided by the total time of travel ) and so average speed is often quite different from a value of instantaneous speed <sos> [ 3 ] if the average speed and the time of travel are known the distance travelled can be calculated by rearranging the definition to <sos> d = <sos> v ¯ <sos> t {\displaystyle d={\boldsymbol {\bar {v}}}t\} <sos> using this equation for an average speed of 80 kilometres per hour on a 4 hour trip the distance covered is found to be 320 kilometres <sos> expressed in graphical language the slope of a tangent line at any point of a distance time graph is the instantaneous speed at this point while the slope of a chord line of the same graph is the average speed during the time interval covered by the chord tangential speed [ edit ] <sos> linear speed is the distance travelled per unit of time while tangential speed ( or tangential velocity ) is the linear speed of something moving along a circular path <sos> [ 5 ] a point on the outside edge of a merry go round or turntable travels a greater distance in one complete rotation than a point nearer the center <sos> travelling a greater distance in the same time means a greater speed and so linear speed is greater on the outer edge of a rotating object than it is closer to the axis <sos> this speed along a circular path is known as tangential speed because the direction of motion is tangent to the circumference of the circle <sos> for circular motion the terms linear speed and tangential speed are used interchangeably and both use units of m/s km/h and others <sos> rotational speed ( or angular speed ) involves the number of revolutions per unit of time <sos> all parts of a rigid merry go round or turntable turn about the axis of rotation in the same amount of time <sos> thus all parts share the same rate of rotation or the same number of rotations or revolutions per unit of time <sos> it is common to express rotational rates in revolutions per minute ( rpm ) or in terms of the number of "" radians "" turned in a unit of time <sos> there are little more than 6 radians in a full rotation ( 2π radians exactly ) <sos> when a direction is assigned to rotational speed it is known as rotational velocity or angular velocity <sos> rotational velocity is a vector whose magnitude is the rotational speed tangential speed and rotational speed are related : the greater the rpms the larger the speed in metres per second <sos> tangential speed is directly proportional to rotational speed at any fixed distance from the axis of rotation <sos> [ 5 ] however tangential speed unlike rotational speed depends on radial distance ( the distance from the axis ) <sos> for a platform rotating with a fixed rotational speed the tangential speed in the centre is zero <sos> towards the edge of the platform the tangential speed increases proportional to the distance from the axis <sos> [ 6 ] in equation form : <sos> v ∝ <sos> r ω <sos> {\displaystyle v\propto \\r\omega \} <sos> where v is tangential speed and ω ( greek letter omega ) is rotational speed <sos> one moves faster if the rate of rotation increases ( a larger value for ω ) and one also moves faster if movement farther from the axis occurs ( a larger value for r ) <sos> move twice as far from the rotational axis at the centre and you move twice as fast <sos> move out three times as far and you have three times as much tangential speed <sos> in any kind of rotating system tangential speed depends on how far you are from the axis of rotation <sos> when proper units are used for tangential speed v rotational speed ω and radial distance r the direct proportion of v to both r and ω becomes the exact equation <sos> v = <sos> r ω <sos> {\displaystyle v=r\omega \} <sos> thus tangential speed will be directly proportional to r when all parts of a system simultaneously have the same ω as for a wheel disk or rigid wand units [ edit ] <sos> main article : conversion of units § speed or velocity <sos> units of speed include : <sos> metres per second ( symbol m s−1 or m/s ) the si

help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources <sos> unsourced material may be challenged and removed <sos> ( july 2010 ) ( learn how and when to remove this template message ) <sos> flash memory ( both nor and nand types ) was invented by fujio masuoka while working for toshiba circa 1980 <sos> [ 4 ] [ 5 ] according to toshiba the name "" flash "" was suggested by masuoka ' s colleague shōji ariizumi because the erasure process of the memory contents reminded him of the flash of a camera <sos> [ 6 ] masuoka and colleagues presented the invention at the ieee 1987 international electron devices meeting ( iedm ) held in san francisco [ 7 ] <sos> intel corporation saw the massive potential of the invention and introduced the first commercial nor type flash chip in 1988 <sos> [ 8 ] nor based flash has long erase and write times but provides full address and data buses allowing random access to any memory location <sos> this makes it a suitable replacement for older read only memory ( rom ) chips which are used to store program code that rarely needs to be updated such as a computer ' s bios or the firmware of set top boxes <sos> its endurance may be from as little as 100 erase cycles for an on chip flash memory [ 9 ] to a more typical 10000 or 100000 erase cycles up to 1000000 erase cycles <sos> [ 10 ] nor based flash was the basis of early flash based removable media ; compactflash was originally based on it though later cards moved to less expensive nand flash nand flash has reduced erase and write times and requires less chip area per cell thus allowing greater storage density and lower cost per bit than nor flash ; it also has up to 10 times the endurance of nor flash <sos> however the i/o interface of nand flash does not provide a random access external address bus <sos> rather data must be read on a block wise basis with typical block sizes of hundreds to thousands of bits <sos> this makes nand flash unsuitable as a drop in replacement for program rom since most microprocessors and microcontrollers require byte level random access <sos> in this regard nand flash is similar to other secondary data storage devices such as hard disks and optical media and is thus highly suitable for use in mass storage devices such as memory cards <sos> the first nand based removable media format was smartmedia in 1995 and many others have followed including : <sos> multimediacard <sos> secure digital <sos> memory stick and xd picture card a new generation of memory card formats including rs mmc minisd and microsd feature extremely small form factors <sos> for example the microsd card has an area of just over 15 cm2 with a thickness of less than 1 mm <sos> as of august 2017 microsd cards with capacity up to 400gb are available [ 11 ] [ 12 ] <sos> principles of operation [ edit ] <sos> a flash memory cell <sos> flash memory stores information in an array of memory cells made from floating gate transistors <sos> in single level cell ( slc ) devices each cell stores only one bit of information <sos> multi level cell ( mlc ) devices including triple level cell ( tlc ) devices can store more than one bit per cell <sos> the floating gate may be conductive ( typically polysilicon in most kinds of flash memory ) or non conductive ( as in sonos flash memory ) [ 13 ] <sos> floating gate transistor [ edit ] <sos> main article : floating gate mosfet <sos> in flash memory each memory cell resembles a standard mosfet except that the transistor has two gates instead of one <sos> on top is the control gate ( cg ) as in other mos transistors but below this there is a floating gate ( fg ) insulated all around by an oxide layer <sos> the fg is interposed between the cg and the mosfet channel <sos> because the fg is electrically isolated by its insulating layer electrons placed on it are trapped until they are removed by another application of electric field ( eg <sos> applied voltage or uv as in eprom ) <sos> counter intuitively placing electrons on the fg sets the transistor to the logical "" 0 "" state <sos> once the fg is charged the electrons in it screen ( partially cancel ) the electric field from the cg thus increasing the threshold voltage ( vt1 ) of the cell <sos> this means that now a higher voltage ( vt2 ) must be applied to the cg to make the channel conductive <sos> in order to read a value from the transistor an intermediate voltage between the threshold voltages ( vt1 & vt2 ) is applied to the cg <sos> if the channel conducts at this intermediate voltage the fg must be uncharged ( if it was charged we would not get conduction because the intermediate voltage is less than vt2 ) and hence a logical "" 1 "" is stored in the gate <sos> if the channel does not conduct at the intermediate voltage it indicates that the fg is charged and hence a logical "" 0 "" is stored in the gate <sos> the presence of a logical "" 0 "" or "" 1 "" is sensed by determining whether there is current flowing through the transistor when the intermediate voltage is asserted on the cg <sos> in a multi level cell device which stores more than one bit per cell the amount of current flow is sensed ( rather than simply its presence or absence ) in order to determine more precisely the level of charge on the fg internal charge pumps [ edit ] <sos> despite the need for high programming and erasing voltages virtually all flash chips today require only a single supply voltage and produce the high voltages using on chip charge pumps over half the energy used by a 18 v nand flash chip is lost in the charge pump itself <sos> since boost converters are inherently more efficient than charge pumps researchers developing low power ssds have proposed returning to the dual vcc/vpp supply voltages used on all the early flash chips driving the high vpp voltage for all flash chips in a ssd with a single shared external boost converter [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] <sos> in spacecraft and other high radiation environments the on chip charge pump is the first part of the flash chip to fail although flash memories will continue to work – in read only mode – at much higher radiation levels [ 22 ] <sos> nor flash [ edit ] <sos> nor flash memory wiring and structure on silicon <sos> in nor flash each cell has one end connected directly to ground and the other end connected directly to a bit line <sos> this arrangement is called "" nor flash "" because it acts like a nor gate : when one of the word lines ( connected to the cell ' s cg ) is brought high the corresponding storage transistor acts to pull the output bit line low <sos> nor flash continues to be the technology of choice for embedded applications requiring a discrete non volatile memory device <sos> the low read latencies characteristic of nor devices allow for both direct code execution and data storage in a single memory product [ 23 ] <sos> programming [ edit ] <sos> programming a nor memory cell ( setting it to logical 0 ) via hot electron injection <sos> erasing a nor memory cell ( setting it to logical 1 ) via quantum tunneling <sos> a single level nor flash cell in its default state is logically equivalent to a binary "" 1 "" value because current will flow through the channel under application of an appropriate voltage to the control gate so that the bitline voltage is pulled down <sos> a nor flash cell can be programmed or set to a binary "" 0 "" value by the following procedure : <sos> an elevated on voltage ( typically >5 v ) is applied to the cg <sos> the channel is now turned on so electrons can flow from the source to the drain ( assuming an nmos transistor ) <sos> the source drain current is sufficiently high to cause some high energy electrons to jump through the insulating layer onto the fg via a process called hot electron injection erasing [ edit ] <sos> to erase a nor flash cell ( resetting it to the "" 1 "" state ) a large voltage of the opposite polarity is applied between the cg and source terminal pulling the electrons off the fg through quantum tunneling <sos> modern nor flash memory chips are divided into erase segments ( often called blocks or sectors ) <sos> the erase operation can be performed only on a block wise basis ; all the cells in an erase segment must be erased together <sos> programming of nor cells however generally can be performed one byte or word at a time nand flash memory wiring and structure on silicon <sos> nand flash [ edit ] <sos> nand flash also uses floating gate transistors but they are connected in a way that resembles a nand gate : several transistors are connected in series and the bit line is pulled low only if all the word lines are pulled high ( above the transistors ' vt ) <sos> these groups are then connected via some additional transistors to a nor style bit line array in the same way that single transistors are linked in nor flash <sos> compared to nor flash replacing single transistors with serial linked groups adds an extra level of addressing <sos> whereas nor flash might address memory by page then word nand flash might address it by page word and bit <sos> bit level addressing suits bit serial applications ( such as hard disk emulation ) which access only one bit at a time <sos> execute in place applications on the other hand require every bit in a word to be accessed simultaneously <sos> this requires word level addressing <sos> in any case both bit and word addressing modes are possible with either nor or nand flash to read data first the desired group is selected ( in the same way that a single transistor is selected from a nor array ) <sos> next most of the word lines are pulled up above the vt of a programmed bit while one of them is pulled up to just over the vt of an erased bit <sos> the series group will conduct ( and pull the bit line low ) if the selected bit has not been programmed <sos> despite the additional transistors the reduction in ground wires and bit lines allows a denser layout and greater storage capacity per chip <sos> ( the ground wires and bit lines are actually much wider than the lines in the diagrams ) <sos> in addition nand flash is typically permitted to contain a certain number of faults ( nor flash as is used for a bios rom is expected to be fault free ) <sos> manufacturers try to maximize the amount of usable storage by shrinking the size of the transistors <sos> writing and erasing [ edit ] <sos> nand flash uses tunnel injection for writing and tunnel release for erasing <sos> nand flash memory forms the core of the removable usb storage devices known as usb flash drives as well as most memory card formats and solid state drives available today vertical nand [ edit ] <sos> vertical nand ( v nand ) memory stacks memory cells vertically and uses a charge trap flash architecture <sos> the vertical layers allow larger areal bit densities without requiring smaller individual cells [ 24 ] <sos> structure [ edit ] <sos> v nand uses a charge trap flash geometry ( pioneered in 2002 by amd ) [ citation needed ] that stores charge on an embedded silicon nitride film <sos> such a film is more robust against point defects and can be made thicker to hold larger numbers of electrons <sos> v nand wraps a planar charge trap cell into a cylindrical form [ 24 ] <sos> an individual memory cell is made up of one planar polysilicon layer containing a hole filled by multiple concentric vertical cylinders <sos> the hole ' s polysilicon surface acts as the gate electrode <sos> the outermost silicon dioxide cylinder acts as the gate dielectric enclosing a silicon nitride cylinder that stores charge in turn enclosing a silicon dioxide cylinder as the tunnel dielectric that surrounds a central rod of conducting polysilicon which acts as the conducting channel [ 24 ] <sos> memory cells in different vertical layers do not interfere with each other as the charges cannot move vertically through the silicon nitride storage medium and the electric fields associated with the gates are closely confined within each layer <sos> the vertical collection is electrically identical to the serial linked groups in which conventional nand flash memory is configured [ 24 ] <sos> construction [ edit ] <sos> growth of a group of v nand cells begins with an alternating stack of conducting ( doped ) polysilicon layers and insulating silicon dioxide layers [ 24 ] <sos> the next step is to form a cylindrical hole through these layers <sos> in practice a 128 gibit v nand chip with 24 layers of memory cells requires about 29 billion such holes <sos> next the hole ' s inner surface receives multiple coatings first silicon dioxide then silicon nitride then a second layer of silicon dioxide <sos> finally the hole is filled with conducting ( doped ) polysilicon [ 24 ] <sos> performance [ edit ] <sos> as of 2013 v nand flash architecture allows read and write operations twice as fast as conventional nand and can last up to 10 times as long while consuming 50 percent less power <sos> they offer comparable physical bit density using 10 nm lithography but may be able to increase bit density by up to two orders of magnitude [ 24 ] <sos> limitations [ edit ] <sos> block erasure [ edit ] <sos> one limitation of flash memory is that although it can be read or programmed a byte or a word at a time in a random access fashion it can be erased only a block at a time <sos> this generally sets all bits in the block to 1 <sos> starting with a freshly erased block any location within that block can be programmed <sos> however once a bit has been set to 0 only by erasing the entire block can it be changed back to 1 <sos> in other words flash memory ( specifically nor flash ) offers random access read and programming operations but does not offer arbitrary random access rewrite or erase operations <sos> a location can however be rewritten as long as the new value ' s 0 bits are a superset of the over written values <sos> for example a nibble value may be erased to 1111 then written as 1110 <sos> successive writes to that nibble can change it to 1010 then 0010 and finally 0000 <sos> essentially erasure sets all bits to 1 and programming can only clear bits to 0 <sos> file systems designed for flash devices can make use of this capability for example to represent sector metadata <sos> although data structures in flash memory cannot be updated in completely general ways this allows members to be "" removed "" by marking them as invalid <sos> this technique may need to be modified for multi level cell devices where one memory cell holds more than one bit common flash devices such as usb flash drives and memory cards provide only a block level interface or flash translation layer ( ftl ) which writes to a different cell each time to wear level the device <sos> this prevents incremental writing within a block ; however it does help the device from being prematurely worn out by intensive write patterns memory wear [ edit ] <sos> another limitation is that flash memory has a finite number of program – erase cycles ( typically written as p/e cycles ) <sos> most commercially available flash products are guaranteed to withstand around 100000 p/e cycles before the wear begins to deteriorate the integrity of the storage <sos> [ 25 ] micron technology and sun microsystems announced an slc nand flash memory chip rated for 1000000 p/e cycles on 17 december 2008 [ 26 ] <sos> the guaranteed cycle count may apply only to block zero ( as is the case with tsop nand devices ) or to all blocks ( as in nor ) <sos> this effect is mitigated in some chip firmware or file system drivers by counting the writes and dynamically remapping blocks in order to spread write operations between sectors ; this technique is called wear leveling <sos> another approach is to perform write verification and remapping to spare sectors in case of write failure a technique called bad block management ( bbm ) <sos> for portable consumer devices these wearout management techniques typically extend the life of the flash memory beyond the life of the device itself and some data loss may be acceptable in these applications <sos> for high reliability data storage however it is not advisable to use flash memory that would have to go through a large number of programming cycles <sos> this limitation is meaningless for ' read only ' applications such as thin clients and routers which are programmed only once or at most a few times during their lifetimes <sos> in december 2012 taiwanese engineers from macronix revealed their intention to announce at the 2012 ieee international electron devices meeting that they had figured out how to improve nand flash storage read/write cycles from 10000 to 100 million cycles using a "" self healing "" process that used a flash chip with "" onboard heaters that could anneal small groups of memory cells <sos> "" [ 27 ] the built in thermal annealing was to replace the usual erase cycle with a local high temperature process that not only erased the stored charge but also repaired the electron induced stress in the chip giving write cycles of at least 100 million <sos> [ 28 ] the result was to be a chip that could be erased and rewritten over and over even when it should theoretically break down <sos> as promising as macronix’s breakthrough might have been for the mobile industry however there were no plans for a commercial product to be released any time in the near future [ 29 ] <sos> read disturb [ edit ] <sos> the method used to read nand flash memory can cause nearby cells in the same memory block to change over time ( become programmed ) <sos> this is known as read disturb <sos> the threshold number of reads is generally in the hundreds of thousands of reads between intervening erase operations <sos> if reading continually from one cell that cell will not fail but rather one of the surrounding cells on a subsequent read <sos> to avoid the read disturb problem the flash controller will typically count the total number of reads to a block since the last erase <sos> when the count exceeds a target limit the affected block is copied over to a new block erased then released to the block pool <sos> the original block is as good as new after the erase <sos> if the flash controller does not intervene in time however a read disturb error will occur with possible data loss if the errors are too numerous to correct with an error correcting code [ 30 ] [ 31 ] <sos> x ray effects [ edit ] <sos> most flash ics come in ball grid array ( bga ) packages and even the ones that do not are often mounted on a pcb next to other bga packages <sos> after pcb assembly boards with bga packages are often x rayed to see if the balls are making proper connections to the proper pad or if the bga needs rework <sos> these x rays can erase programmed bits in a flash chip ( convert programmed "" 0 "" bits into erased "" 1 "" bits ) <sos> erased bits ( "" 1 "" bits ) are not affected by x rays [ 32 ] [ 33 ] <sos> some manufacturers are now making x ray proof sd [ 34 ] and usb [ 35 ] memory devices low level access [ edit ] <sos> the low level interface to flash memory chips differs from those of other memory types such as dram rom and eeprom which support bit alterability ( both zero to one and one to zero ) and random access via externally accessible address buses <sos> nor memory has an external address bus for reading and programming <sos> for nor memory reading and programming are random access and unlocking and erasing are block wise <sos> for nand memory reading and programming are page wise and unlocking and erasing are block wise <sos> nor memories [ edit ] <sos> nor flash by intel <sos> reading from nor flash is similar to reading from random access memory provided the address and data bus are mapped correctly <sos> because of this most microprocessors can use nor flash memory as execute in place ( xip ) memory meaning that programs stored in nor flash can be executed directly from the nor flash without needing to be copied into ram first <sos> nor flash may be programmed in a random access manner similar to reading <sos> programming changes bits from a logical one to a zero <sos> bits that are already zero are left unchanged <sos> erasure must happen a block at a time and resets all the bits in the erased block back to one <sos> typical block sizes are 64 128 or 256 kib bad block management is a relatively new feature in nor chips <sos> in older nor devices not supporting bad block management the software or device driver controlling the memory chip must correct for blocks that wear out or the device will cease to work reliably <sos> the specific commands used to lock unlock program or erase nor memories differ for each manufacturer <sos> to avoid needing unique driver software for every device made special common flash memory interface ( cfi ) commands allow the device to identify itself and its critical operating parameters <sos> besides its use as random access rom nor flash can also be used as a storage device by taking advantage of random access programming <sos> some devices offer read while write functionality so that code continues to execute even while a program or erase operation is occurring in the background <sos> for sequential data writes nor flash chips typically have slow write speeds compared with nand flash <sos> typical nor flash does not need an error correcting code [ 36 ] <sos> nand memories [ edit ] <sos> nand flash architecture was introduced by toshiba in 1989 <sos> [ 37 ] these memories are accessed much like block devices such as hard disks <sos> each block consists of a number of pages <sos> the pages are typically 512 [ 38 ] or 2048 or 4096 bytes in size <sos> associated with each page are a few bytes ( typically 1/32 of the data size ) that can be used for storage of an error correcting code ( ecc ) checksum <sos> typical block sizes include : <sos> 32 pages of 512+16 bytes each for a block size ( effective ) of 16 kb <sos> 64 pages of 2048+64 bytes each for a block size of 128 kb [ 39 ] <sos> 64 pages of 4096+128 bytes each for a block size of 256 kb [ 40 ] <sos> 128 pages of 4096+128 bytes each for a block size of 512 kb <sos> while reading and programming is performed on a page basis erasure can only be performed on a block basis [ 41 ] <sos> nand devices also require bad block management by the device driver software or by a separate controller chip <sos> sd cards for example include controller circuitry to perform bad block management and wear leveling <sos> when a logical block is accessed by high level software it is mapped to a physical block by the device driver or controller <sos> a number of blocks on the flash chip may be set aside for storing mapping tables to deal with bad blocks or the system may simply check each block at power up to create a bad block map in ram <sos> the overall memory capacity gradually shrinks as more blocks are marked as bad nand relies on ecc to compensate for bits that may spontaneously fail during normal device operation <sos> a typical ecc will correct a one bit error in each 2048 bits ( 256 bytes ) using 22 bits of ecc or a one bit error in each 4096 bits ( 512 bytes ) using 24 bits of ecc <sos> [ 42 ] if the ecc cannot correct the error during read it may still detect the error <sos> when doing erase or program operations the device can detect blocks that fail to program or erase and mark them bad <sos> the data is then written to a different good block and the bad block map is updated hamming codes are the most commonly used ecc for slc nand flash <sos> reed solomon codes and bose chaudhuri hocquenghem codes are commonly used ecc for mlc nand flash <sos> some mlc nand flash chips internally generate the appropriate bch error correction codes [ 36 ] <sos> most nand devices are shipped from the factory with some bad blocks <sos> these are typically marked according to a specified bad block marking strategy <sos> by allowing some bad blocks the manufacturers achieve far higher yields than would be possible if all blocks had to be verified good <sos> this significantly reduces nand flash costs and only slightly decreases the storage capacity of the parts <sos> when executing software from nand memories virtual memory strategies are often used : memory contents must first be paged or copied into memory mapped ram and executed there ( leading to the common combination of nand + ram ) <sos> a memory management unit ( mmu ) in the system is helpful but this can also be accomplished with overlays <sos> for this reason some systems will use a combination of nor and nand memories where a smaller nor memory is used as software rom and a larger nand memory is partitioned with a file system for use as a non volatile data storage area nand sacrifices the random access and execute in place advantages of nor <sos> nand is best suited to systems requiring high capacity data storage <sos> it offers higher densities larger capacities and lower cost <sos> it has faster erases sequential writes and sequential reads <sos> standardization [ edit ] <sos> a group called the open nand flash interface working group ( onfi ) has developed a standardized low level interface for nand flash chips <sos> this allows interoperability between conforming nand devices from different vendors <sos> the onfi specification version 10 [ 43 ] was released on 28 december 2006 <sos> it specifies : <sos> a standard physical interface ( pinout ) for nand flash in tsop 48 wsop 48 lga 52 and bga 63 packages <sos> a standard command set for reading writing and erasing nand flash chips <sos> a mechanism for self identification ( comparable to the serial presence detection feature of sdram memory modules ) <sos> the onfi group is supported by major nand flash manufacturers including hynix intel micron technology and numonyx as well as by major manufacturers of devices incorporating nand flash chips [ 44 ] <sos> two major flash device manufacturers toshiba and samsung have chosen to use an interface of their own design known as toggle mode ( and now toggle v20 ) <sos> this interface isn ' t pin to pin compatible with the onfi specification <sos> the result is a product designed for one vendor ' s devices may not be able to use another vendor ' s devices [ 45 ] <sos> a group of vendors including intel dell and microsoft formed a non volatile memory host controller interface ( nvmhci ) working group <sos> [ 46 ] the goal of the group is to provide standard software and hardware programming interfaces for nonvolatile memory subsystems including the "" flash cache "" device connected to the pci express bus <sos> distinction between nor and nand flash [ edit ] <sos> nor and nand flash differ in two important ways : <sos> the connections of the individual memory cells are different <sos> the interface provided for reading and writing the memory is different ( nor allows random access for reading nand allows only page access ) <sos> these two are linked by the design choices made in the development of nand flash <sos> a goal of nand flash development was to reduce the chip area required to implement a given capacity of flash memory and thereby to reduce cost per bit and increase maximum chip capacity so that flash memory could compete with magnetic storage devices like hard disks <sos> [ citation needed ] <sos> nor and nand flash get their names from the structure of the interconnections between memory cells <sos> [ 47 ] in nor flash cells are connected in parallel to the bit lines allowing cells to be read and programmed individually <sos> the parallel connection of cells resembles the parallel connection of transistors in a cmos nor gate <sos> in nand flash cells are connected in series resembling a nand gate <sos> the series connections consume less space than parallel ones reducing the cost of nand flash <sos> it does not by itself prevent nand cells from being read and programmed individually each nor flash cell is larger than a nand flash cell – 10 f2 vs 4 f2 – even when using exactly the same semiconductor device fabrication and so each transistor contact etc <sos> is exactly the same size – because nor flash cells require a separate metal contact for each cell [ 48 ] <sos> when nor flash was developed it was envisioned as a more economical and conveniently rewritable rom than contemporary eprom and eeprom memories <sos> thus random access reading circuitry was necessary <sos> however it was expected that nor flash rom would be read much more often than written so the write circuitry included was fairly slow and could erase only in a block wise fashion <sos> on the other hand applications that use flash as a replacement for disk drives do not require word level write address which would only add to the complexity and cost unnecessarily <sos> [ citation needed ] <sos> because of the series connection and removal of wordline contacts a large grid of nand flash memory cells will occupy perhaps only 60% of the area of equivalent nor cells [ 49 ] ( assuming the same cmos process resolution for example 130 nm 90 nm or 65 nm ) <sos> nand flash ' s designers realized that the area of a nand chip and thus the cost could be further reduced by removing the external address and data bus circuitry <sos> instead external devices could communicate with nand flash via sequential accessed command and data registers which would internally retrieve and output the necessary data <sos> this design choice made random access of nand flash memory impossible

endurance [ edit ] <sos> the write endurance of slc floating gate nor flash is typically equal to or greater than that of nand flash while mlc nor and nand flash have similar endurance capabilities

of a storage system can be tuned to serve specific requirements [ 2 ] [ 56 ] <sos> in order to compute the longevity of the nand flash one must account for the size of the memory chip the type of memory ( eg <sos> slc/mlc/tlc ) and use pattern <sos> flash file systems [ edit ] <sos> main article : flash file system <sos> because of the particular characteristics of flash memory it is best used with either a controller to perform wear leveling and error correction or specifically designed flash file systems which spread writes over the media and deal with the long erase times of nor flash blocks <sos> [ 57 ] the basic concept behind flash file systems is the following : when the flash store is to be updated the file system will write a new copy of the changed data to a fresh block remap the file pointers then erase the old block later when it has time <sos> in practice flash file systems are used only for memory technology devices ( mtds ) which are embedded flash memories that do not have a controller <sos> removable flash memory cards and usb flash drives have built in controllers to perform wear leveling and error correction so use of a specific flash file system does not add any benefit capacity [ edit ] <sos> multiple chips are often arrayed to achieve higher capacities [ 58 ] for use in consumer electronic devices such as multimedia players or gpss <sos> the capacity of flash chips generally follows moore ' s law because they are manufactured with many of the same integrated circuits techniques and equipment consumer flash storage devices typically are advertised with usable sizes expressed as a small integer power of two ( 2 4 8 etc ) <sos> and a designation of megabytes ( mb ) or gigabytes ( gb ) ; eg 512 mb 8 gb <sos> this includes ssds marketed as hard drive replacements in accordance with traditional hard drives which use decimal prefixes <sos> [ 59 ] thus an ssd marked as “64 gb” is at least 64 × 10003 bytes ( 64 gb ) <sos> most users will have slightly less capacity than this available for their files due to the space taken by file system metadata <sos> the flash memory chips inside them are sized in strict binary multiples but the actual total capacity of the chips is not usable at the drive interface <sos> it is considerably larger than the advertised capacity in order to allow for distribution of writes ( wear leveling ) for sparing for error correction codes and for other metadata needed by the device ' s internal firmware <sos> in 2005 toshiba and sandisk developed a nand flash chip capable of storing 1 gb of data using multi level cell ( mlc ) technology capable of storing two bits of data per cell <sos> in september 2005 samsung electronics announced that it had developed the world’s first 2 gb chip [ 60 ] <sos> in march 2006 samsung announced flash hard drives with a capacity of 4 gb essentially the same order of magnitude as smaller laptop hard drives and in september 2006 samsung announced an 8 gb chip produced using a 40 nm manufacturing process <sos> [ 61 ] in january 2008 sandisk announced availability of their 16 gb microsdhc and 32 gb sdhc plus cards [ 62 ] [ 63 ] <sos> more recent flash drives ( as of 2012 ) have much greater capacities holding 64 128 and 256 gb [ 64 ] <sos> a joint development at intel and micron will allow the production of 32 layer 35 terabyte ( tb ) nand flash sticks and 10 tb standard sized ssds <sos> the device includes 5 packages of 16 × 48 gb tlc dies using a floating gate cell design [ 65 ] <sos> flash chips continue to be manufactured with capacities under or around 1 mb eg for bios roms and embedded applications <sos> in july 2016 samsung announced the 4tb samsung 850 evo which utilizes their 256 gb 48 layer tlc 3d v nand <sos> [ 66 ] in august 2016 samsung announced a 32 tb 25 inch sas ssd based on their 512 gb 64 layer tlc 3d v nand <sos> further samsung expects to unveil ssds with up to 100 tb of storage by 2020 [ 67 ] <sos> transfer rates [ edit ] <sos> flash memory devices are typically much faster at reading than writing <sos> [ 68 ] performance also depends on the quality of storage controllers which become more critical when devices are partially full <sos> [ 68 ] even when the only change to manufacturing is die shrink the absence of an appropriate controller can result in degraded speeds [ 69 ] <sos> applications [ edit ] <sos> serial flash [ edit ] <sos> serial flash : silicon storage tech sst25vf080b <sos> serial flash is a small low power flash memory that provides only serial access to the data rather than addressing individual bytes the user reads or writes large contiguous groups of bytes in the address space serially <sos> serial peripheral interface bus ( spi ) is a typical protocol for accessing the device <sos> when incorporated into an embedded system serial flash requires fewer wires on the pcb than parallel flash memories since it transmits and receives data one bit at a time <sos> this may permit a reduction in board space power consumption and total system cost <sos> there are several reasons why a serial device with fewer external pins than a parallel device can significantly reduce overall cost : <sos> many asics are pad limited meaning that the size of the die is constrained by the number of wire bond pads rather than the complexity and number of gates used for the device logic <sos> eliminating bond pads thus permits a more compact integrated circuit on a smaller die ; this increases the number of dies that may be fabricated on a wafer and thus reduces the cost per die reducing the number of external pins also reduces assembly and packaging costs <sos> a serial device may be packaged in a smaller and simpler package than a parallel device <sos> smaller and lower pin count packages occupy less pcb area lower pin count devices simplify pcb routing <sos> there are two major spi flash types <sos> the first type is characterized by small pages and one or more internal sram page buffers allowing a complete page to be read to the buffer partially modified and then written back ( for example the atmel at45 dataflash or the micron technology page erase nor flash ) <sos> the second type has larger sectors <sos> the smallest sectors typically found in an spi flash are 4 kb but they can be as large as 64 kb <sos> since the spi flash lacks an internal sram buffer the complete page must be read out and modified before being written back making it slow to manage <sos> spi flash is cheaper than dataflash and is therefore a good choice when the application is code shadowing <sos> the two types are not easily exchangeable since they do not have the same pinout and the command sets are incompatible firmware storage [ edit ] <sos> with the increasing speed of modern cpus parallel flash devices are often much slower than the memory bus of the computer they are connected to <sos> conversely modern sram offers access times below 10 ns while ddr2 sdram offers access times below 20 ns <sos> because of this it is often desirable to shadow code stored in flash into ram ; that is the code is copied from flash into ram before execution so that the cpu may access it at full speed <sos> device firmware may be stored in a serial flash device and then copied into sdram or sram when the device is powered up <sos> [ 70 ] using an external serial flash device rather than on chip flash removes the need for significant process compromise ( a process that is good for high speed logic is generally not good for flash and vice versa ) <sos> once it is decided to read the firmware in as one big block it is common to add compression to allow a smaller flash chip to be used <sos> typical applications for serial flash include storing firmware for hard drives ethernet controllers dsl modems wireless network devices etc <sos> flash memory as a replacement for hard drives [ edit ] <sos> main article : solid state drive <sos> one more recent application for flash memory is as a replacement for hard disks <sos> flash memory does not have the mechanical limitations and latencies of hard drives so a solid state drive ( ssd ) is attractive when considering speed noise power consumption and reliability <sos> flash drives are gaining traction as mobile device secondary storage devices ; they are also used as substitutes for hard drives in high performance desktop computers and some servers with raid and san architectures <sos> there remain some aspects of flash based ssds that make them unattractive <sos> the cost per gigabyte of flash memory remains significantly higher than that of hard disks <sos> [ 71 ] also flash memory has a finite number of p/e cycles but this seems to be currently under control since warranties on flash based ssds are approaching those of current hard drives <sos> [ 72 ] in addition deleted files on ssds can remain for an indefinite period of time before being overwritten by fresh data ; erasure or shred techniques or software that work well on magnetic hard disk drives have no effect on ssds compromising security and forensic examination for relational databases or other systems that require acid transactions even a modest amount of flash storage can offer vast speedups over arrays of disk drives [ 73 ] [ 74 ] <sos> in june 2006 samsung electronics released the first flash memory based pcs the q1 ssd and q30 ssd both of which used 32 gb ssds and were at least initially available only in south korea [ 75 ] <sos> a solid state drive was offered as an option with the first macbook air introduced in 2008 and from 2010 onwards all models shipped with an ssd <sos> starting in late 2011 as part of intel ' s ultrabook initiative an increasing number of ultra thin laptops are being shipped with ssds standard <sos> there are also hybrid techniques such as hybrid drive and readyboost that attempt to combine the advantages of both technologies using flash as a high speed non volatile cache for files on the disk that are often referenced but rarely modified such as application and operating system executable files <sos> flash memory as ram [ edit ] <sos> as of 2012 there are attempts to use flash memory as the main computer memory dram [ 76 ] <sos> archival or long term storage [ edit ] <sos> it is unclear how long flash memory will persist under archival conditions – ie benign temperature and humidity with infrequent access with or without prophylactic rewrite <sos> anecdotal evidence [ specify ] suggests that the technology is reasonably robust on the scale of years <sos> [ citation needed ] datasheets of atmel ' s flash based "" atmega "" microcontrollers typically promise retention times of 20 years at 85 °c and 100 years at 25 °c [ 77 ] <sos> an article from cmu in 2015 writes that "" today ' s flash devices which do not require flash refresh have a typical retention age of 1 year at room temperature "" <sos> and that temperature can lower the retention time exponentially <sos> the phenomenon can be modeled by arrhenius law [ 78 ] <sos> industry [ edit ] <sos> one source states that in 2008 the flash memory industry includes about us$91 billion in production and sales <sos> other sources put the flash memory market at a size of more than us$20 billion in 2006 accounting for more than eight percent of the overall semiconductor market and more than 34 percent of the

rates that accompany feature size shrinking can be compensated by improved error correction mechanisms <sos> [ 83 ] even with these advances it may be impossible to economically scale flash to smaller

flash memory is an electronic ( solid state ) non volatile computer storage medium that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed toshiba developed flash memory from eeprom ( electrically erasable programmable read only memory ) in the early 1980s and introduced it to the market in 1984 <sos> the two main types of flash memory are named after the nand and nor logic gates <sos> the individual flash memory cells exhibit internal characteristics similar to those of the corresponding gates <sos> while eproms had to be completely erased before being rewritten nand type flash memory may be written and read in blocks ( or pages ) which are generally much smaller than the entire device <sos> nor type flash allows a single machine word ( byte ) to be written – to an erased location – or read independently <sos> the nand type operates primarily in memory cards usb flash drives solid state drives ( those produced in 2009 or later ) and similar products for general storage and transfer of data <sos> nand or nor flash memory is also often used to store configuration data in numerous digital products a task previously made possible by eeprom or battery powered static ram <sos> one key disadvantage of flash memory is that it can only endure a relatively small number of write cycles in a specific block [ 1 ] <sos> example applications of both types of flash memory include personal computers pdas digital audio players digital cameras mobile phones synthesizers video games scientific instrumentation industrial robotics and medical electronics <sos> in addition to being non volatile flash memory offers fast read access times although not as fast as static ram or rom <sos> [ 2 ] its mechanical shock resistance helps explain its popularity over hard disks in portable devices as does its high durability ability to withstand high pressure temperature and immersion in water etc [ 3 ] <sos> although flash memory is technically a type of eeprom the term "" eeprom "" is generally used to refer specifically to non flash eeprom which is erasable in small blocks typically bytes <sos> [ citation needed ] because erase cycles are slow the large block sizes used in flash memory erasing give it a significant speed advantage over non flash eeprom when writing large amounts of data <sos> as of 2013 [ update ] [ needs update ? ] <sos> flash memory costs much less than byte programmable eeprom and had become the dominant memory type wherever a system required a significant amount of non volatile solid state storage <sos> contents <sos> 1 history <sos> 2 principles

verification <sos> please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources <sos> unsourced material may be challenged and removed <sos> ( july 2010 ) ( learn how and when to remove this template message ) <sos> flash memory ( both nor and nand types ) was invented by fujio masuoka while working for toshiba circa 1980 <sos> [ 4 ] [ 5 ] according to toshiba the name "" flash "" was suggested by masuoka ' s colleague shōji ariizumi because the erasure process of the memory contents reminded him of the flash of a camera <sos> [ 6 ] masuoka and colleagues presented the invention at the ieee 1987 international electron devices meeting ( iedm ) held in san francisco [ 7 ] <sos> intel corporation saw the massive potential of the invention and introduced the first commercial nor type flash chip in 1988 <sos> [ 8 ] nor based flash has long erase and write times but provides full address and data buses allowing random access to any memory location <sos> this makes it a suitable replacement for older read only memory ( rom ) chips which are used to store program code that rarely needs to be updated such as a computer ' s bios or the firmware of set top boxes <sos> its endurance may be from as little as 100 erase cycles for an on chip flash memory [ 9 ] to a more typical 10000 or 100000 erase cycles up to 1000000 erase cycles <sos> [ 10 ] nor based flash was the basis of early flash based removable media ; compactflash was originally based on it though later cards moved to less expensive nand flash nand flash has reduced erase and write times and requires less chip area per cell thus allowing greater storage density and lower cost per bit than nor flash ; it also has up to 10 times the endurance of nor flash <sos> however the i/o interface of nand flash does not provide a random access external address bus <sos> rather data must be read on a block wise basis with typical block sizes of hundreds to thousands of bits <sos> this makes nand flash unsuitable as a drop in replacement for program rom since most microprocessors and microcontrollers require byte level random access <sos> in this regard nand flash is similar to other secondary data storage devices such as hard disks and optical media and is thus highly suitable for use in mass storage devices such as memory cards <sos> the first nand based removable media format was smartmedia in 1995 and many others have followed including : <sos> multimediacard <sos> secure digital <sos> memory stick and xd picture card a new generation of memory card formats including rs mmc minisd and microsd feature extremely small form factors <sos> for example the microsd card has an area of just over 15 cm2 with a thickness of less than 1 mm <sos> as of august 2017 microsd cards with capacity up to 400gb are available [ 11 ] [ 12 ] <sos> principles of operation [ edit ] <sos> a flash memory cell <sos> flash memory stores information in an array of memory cells made from floating gate transistors <sos> in single level cell ( slc ) devices each cell stores only one bit of information <sos> multi level cell ( mlc ) devices including triple level cell ( tlc ) devices can store more than one bit per cell <sos> the floating gate may be conductive ( typically polysilicon in most kinds of flash memory ) or non conductive ( as in sonos flash memory ) [ 13 ] <sos> floating gate transistor [ edit ] <sos> main article : floating gate mosfet <sos> in flash memory each memory cell resembles a standard mosfet except that the transistor has two gates instead of one <sos> on top is the control gate ( cg ) as in other mos transistors but below this there is a floating gate ( fg ) insulated all around by an oxide layer <sos> the fg is interposed between the cg and the mosfet channel <sos> because the fg is electrically isolated by its insulating layer electrons placed on it are trapped until they are removed by another application of electric field ( eg <sos> applied voltage or uv as in eprom ) <sos> counter intuitively placing electrons on the fg sets the transistor to the logical "" 0 "" state <sos> once the fg is charged the electrons in it screen ( partially cancel ) the electric field from the cg thus increasing the threshold voltage ( vt1 ) of the cell <sos> this means that now a higher voltage ( vt2 ) must be applied to the cg to make the channel conductive <sos> in order to read a value from the transistor an intermediate voltage between the threshold voltages ( vt1 & vt2 ) is applied to the cg <sos> if the channel conducts at this intermediate voltage the fg must be uncharged ( if it was charged we would not get conduction because the intermediate voltage is less than vt2 ) and hence a logical "" 1 "" is stored in the gate <sos> if the channel does not conduct at the intermediate voltage it indicates that the fg is charged and hence a logical "" 0 "" is stored in the gate <sos> the presence of a logical "" 0 "" or "" 1 "" is sensed by determining whether there is current flowing through the transistor when the intermediate voltage is asserted on the cg <sos> in a multi level cell device which stores more than one bit per cell the amount of current flow is sensed ( rather than simply its presence or absence ) in order to determine more precisely the level of charge on the fg internal charge pumps [ edit ] <sos> despite the need for high programming and erasing voltages virtually all flash chips today require only a single supply voltage and produce the high voltages using on chip charge pumps over half the energy used by a 18 v nand flash chip is lost in the charge pump itself <sos> since boost converters are inherently more efficient than charge pumps researchers developing low power ssds have proposed returning to the dual vcc/vpp supply voltages used on all the early flash chips driving the high vpp voltage for all flash chips in a ssd with a single shared external boost converter [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] <sos> in spacecraft and other high radiation environments the on chip charge pump is the first part of the flash chip to fail although flash memories will continue to work – in read only mode – at much higher radiation levels [ 22 ] <sos> nor flash [ edit ] <sos> nor flash memory wiring and structure on silicon <sos> in nor flash each cell has one end connected directly to ground and the other end connected directly to a bit line <sos> this arrangement is called "" nor flash "" because it acts like a nor gate : when one of the word lines ( connected to the cell ' s cg ) is brought high the corresponding storage transistor acts to pull the output bit line low <sos> nor flash continues to be the technology of choice for embedded applications requiring a discrete non volatile memory device <sos> the low read latencies characteristic of nor devices allow for both direct code execution and data storage in a single memory product [ 23 ] <sos> programming [ edit ] <sos> programming a nor memory cell ( setting it to logical 0 ) via hot electron injection <sos> erasing a nor memory cell ( setting it to logical 1 ) via quantum tunneling <sos> a single level nor flash cell in its default state is logically equivalent to a binary "" 1 "" value because current will flow through the channel under application of an appropriate voltage to the control gate so that the bitline voltage is pulled down <sos> a nor flash cell can be programmed or set to a binary "" 0 "" value by the following procedure : <sos> an elevated on voltage ( typically >5 v ) is applied to the cg <sos> the channel is now turned on so electrons can flow from the source to the drain ( assuming an nmos transistor ) <sos> the source drain current is sufficiently high to cause some high energy electrons to jump through the insulating layer onto the fg via a process called hot electron injection erasing [ edit ] <sos> to erase a nor flash cell ( resetting it to the "" 1 "" state ) a large voltage of the opposite polarity is applied between the cg and source terminal pulling the electrons off the fg through quantum tunneling <sos> modern nor flash memory chips are divided into erase segments ( often called blocks or sectors ) <sos> the erase operation can be performed only on a block wise basis ; all the cells in an erase segment must be erased together <sos> programming of nor cells however generally can be performed one byte or word at a time nand flash memory wiring and structure on silicon <sos> nand flash [ edit ] <sos> nand flash also uses floating gate transistors but they are connected in a way that resembles a nand gate : several transistors are connected in series and the bit line is pulled low only if all the word lines are pulled high ( above the transistors ' vt ) <sos> these groups are then connected via some additional transistors to a nor style bit line array in the same way that single transistors are linked in nor flash <sos> compared to nor flash replacing single transistors with serial linked groups adds an extra level of addressing <sos> whereas nor flash might address memory by page then word nand flash might address it by page word and bit <sos> bit level addressing suits bit serial applications ( such as hard disk emulation ) which access only one bit at a time <sos> execute in place applications on the other hand require every bit in a word to be accessed simultaneously <sos> this requires word level addressing <sos> in any case both bit and word addressing modes are possible with either nor or nand flash to read data first the desired group is selected ( in the same way that a single transistor is selected from a nor array ) <sos> next most of the word lines are pulled up above the vt of a programmed bit while one of them is pulled up to just over the vt of an erased bit <sos> the series group will conduct ( and pull the bit line low ) if the selected bit has not been programmed <sos> despite the additional transistors the reduction in ground wires and bit lines allows a denser layout and greater storage capacity per chip <sos> ( the ground wires and bit lines are actually much wider than the lines in the diagrams ) <sos> in addition nand flash is typically permitted to contain a certain number of faults ( nor flash as is used for a bios rom is expected to be fault free ) <sos> manufacturers try to maximize the amount of usable storage by shrinking the size of the transistors <sos> writing and erasing [ edit ] <sos> nand flash uses tunnel injection for writing and tunnel release for erasing <sos> nand flash memory forms the core of the removable usb storage devices known as usb flash drives as well as most memory card formats and solid state drives available today vertical nand [ edit ] <sos> vertical nand ( v nand ) memory stacks memory cells vertically and uses a charge trap flash architecture <sos> the vertical layers allow larger areal bit densities without requiring smaller individual cells [ 24 ] <sos> structure [ edit ] <sos> v nand uses a charge trap flash geometry ( pioneered in 2002 by amd ) [ citation needed ] that stores charge on an embedded silicon nitride film <sos> such a film is more robust against point defects and can be made thicker to hold larger numbers of electrons <sos> v nand wraps a planar charge trap cell into a cylindrical form [ 24 ] <sos> an individual memory cell is made up of one planar polysilicon layer containing a hole filled by multiple concentric vertical cylinders <sos> the hole ' s polysilicon surface acts as the gate electrode <sos> the outermost silicon dioxide cylinder acts as the gate dielectric enclosing a silicon nitride cylinder that stores charge in turn enclosing a silicon dioxide cylinder as the tunnel dielectric that surrounds a central rod of conducting polysilicon which acts as the conducting channel [ 24 ] <sos> memory cells in different vertical layers do not interfere with each other as the charges cannot move vertically through the silicon nitride storage medium and the electric fields associated with the gates are closely confined within each layer <sos> the vertical collection is electrically identical to the serial linked groups in which conventional nand flash memory is configured [ 24 ] <sos> construction [ edit ] <sos> growth of a group of v nand cells begins with an alternating stack of conducting ( doped ) polysilicon layers and insulating silicon dioxide layers [ 24 ] <sos> the next step is to form a cylindrical hole through these layers <sos> in practice a 128 gibit v nand chip with 24 layers of memory cells requires about 29 billion such holes <sos> next the hole ' s inner surface receives multiple coatings first silicon dioxide then silicon nitride then a second layer of silicon dioxide <sos> finally the hole is filled with conducting ( doped ) polysilicon [ 24 ] <sos> performance [ edit ] <sos> as of 2013 v nand flash architecture allows read and write operations twice as fast as conventional nand and can last up to 10 times as long while consuming 50 percent less power <sos> they offer comparable physical bit density using 10 nm lithography but may be able to increase bit density by up to two orders of magnitude [ 24 ] <sos> limitations [ edit ] <sos> block erasure [ edit ] <sos> one limitation of flash memory is that although it can be read or programmed a byte or a word at a time in a random access fashion it can be erased only a block at a time <sos> this generally sets all bits in the block to 1 <sos> starting with a freshly erased block any location within that block can be programmed <sos> however once a bit has been set to 0 only by erasing the entire block can it be changed back to 1 <sos> in other words flash memory ( specifically nor flash ) offers random access read and programming operations but does not offer arbitrary random access rewrite or erase operations <sos> a location can however be rewritten as long as the new value ' s 0 bits are a superset of the over written values <sos> for example a nibble value may be erased to 1111 then written as 1110 <sos> successive writes to that nibble can change it to 1010 then 0010 and finally 0000 <sos> essentially erasure sets all bits to 1 and programming can only clear bits to 0 <sos> file systems designed for flash devices can make use of this capability for example to represent sector metadata <sos> although data structures in flash memory cannot be updated in completely general ways this allows members to be "" removed "" by marking them as invalid <sos> this technique may need to be modified for multi level cell devices where one memory cell holds more than one bit common flash devices such as usb flash drives and memory cards provide only a block level interface or flash translation layer ( ftl ) which writes to a different cell each time to wear level the device <sos> this prevents incremental writing within a block ; however it does help the device from being prematurely worn out by intensive write patterns memory wear [ edit ] <sos> another limitation is that flash memory has a finite number of program – erase cycles ( typically written as p/e cycles ) <sos> most commercially available flash products are guaranteed to withstand around 100000 p/e cycles before the wear begins to deteriorate the integrity of the storage <sos> [ 25 ] micron technology and sun microsystems announced an slc nand flash memory chip rated for 1000000 p/e cycles on 17 december 2008 [ 26 ] <sos> the guaranteed cycle count may apply only to block zero ( as is the case with tsop nand devices ) or to all blocks ( as in nor ) <sos> this effect is mitigated in some chip firmware or file system drivers by counting the writes and dynamically remapping blocks in order to spread write operations between sectors ; this technique is called wear leveling <sos> another approach is to perform write verification and remapping to spare sectors in case of write failure a technique called bad block management ( bbm ) <sos> for portable consumer devices these wearout management techniques typically extend the life of the flash memory beyond the life of the device itself and some data loss may be acceptable in these applications <sos> for high reliability data storage however it is not advisable to use flash memory that would have to go through a large number of programming cycles <sos> this limitation is meaningless for ' read only ' applications such as thin clients and routers which are programmed only once or at most a few times during their lifetimes <sos> in december 2012 taiwanese engineers from macronix revealed their intention to announce at the 2012 ieee international electron devices meeting that they had figured out how to improve nand flash storage read/write cycles from 10000 to 100 million cycles using a "" self healing "" process that used a flash chip with "" onboard heaters that could anneal small groups of memory cells <sos> "" [ 27 ] the built in thermal annealing was to replace the usual erase cycle with a local high temperature process that not only erased the stored charge but also repaired the electron induced stress in the chip giving write cycles of at least 100 million <sos> [ 28 ] the result was to be a chip that could be erased and rewritten over and over even when it should theoretically break down <sos> as promising as macronix’s breakthrough might have been for the mobile industry however there were no plans for a commercial product to be released any time in the near future [ 29 ] <sos> read disturb [ edit ] <sos> the method used to read nand flash memory can cause nearby cells in the same memory block to change over time ( become programmed ) <sos> this is known as read disturb <sos> the threshold number of reads is generally in the hundreds of thousands of reads between intervening erase operations <sos> if reading continually from one cell that cell will not fail but rather one of the surrounding cells on a subsequent read <sos> to avoid the read disturb problem the flash controller will typically count the total number of reads to a block since the last erase <sos> when the count exceeds a target limit the affected block is copied over to a new block erased then released to the block pool <sos> the original block is as good as new after the erase <sos> if the flash controller does not intervene in time however a read disturb error will occur with possible data loss if the errors are too numerous to correct with an error correcting code [ 30 ] [ 31 ] <sos> x ray effects [ edit ] <sos> most flash ics come in ball grid array ( bga ) packages and even the ones that do not are often mounted on a pcb next to other bga packages <sos> after pcb assembly boards with bga packages are often x rayed to see if the balls are making proper connections to the proper pad or if the bga needs rework <sos> these x rays can erase programmed bits in a flash chip ( convert programmed "" 0 "" bits into erased "" 1 "" bits ) <sos> erased bits ( "" 1 "" bits ) are not affected by x rays [ 32 ] [ 33 ] <sos> some manufacturers are now making x ray proof sd [ 34 ] and usb [ 35 ] memory devices low level access [ edit ] <sos> the low level interface to flash memory chips differs from those of other memory types such as dram rom and eeprom which support bit alterability ( both zero to one and one to zero ) and random access via externally accessible address buses <sos> nor memory has an external address bus for reading and programming <sos> for nor memory reading and programming are random access and unlocking and erasing are block wise <sos> for nand memory reading and programming are page wise and unlocking and erasing are block wise <sos> nor memories [ edit ] <sos> nor flash by intel <sos> reading from nor flash is similar to reading from random access memory provided the address and data bus are mapped correctly <sos> because of this most microprocessors can use nor flash memory as execute in place ( xip ) memory meaning that programs stored in nor flash can be executed directly from the nor flash without needing to be copied into ram first <sos> nor flash may be programmed in a random access manner similar to reading <sos> programming changes bits from a logical one to a zero <sos> bits that are already zero are left unchanged <sos> erasure must happen a block at a time and resets all the bits in the erased block back to one <sos> typical block sizes are 64 128 or 256 kib bad block management is a relatively new feature in nor chips <sos> in older nor devices not supporting bad block management the software or device driver controlling the memory chip must correct for blocks that wear out or the device will cease to work reliably <sos> the specific commands used to lock unlock program or erase nor memories differ for each manufacturer <sos> to avoid needing unique driver software for every device made special common flash memory interface ( cfi ) commands allow the device to identify itself and its critical operating parameters <sos> besides its use as random access rom nor flash can also be used as a storage device by taking advantage of random access programming <sos> some devices offer read while write functionality so that code continues to execute even while a program or erase operation is occurring in the background <sos> for sequential data writes nor flash chips typically have slow write speeds compared with nand flash <sos> typical nor flash does not need an error correcting code [ 36 ] <sos> nand memories [ edit ] <sos> nand flash architecture was introduced by toshiba in 1989 <sos> [ 37 ] these memories are accessed much like block devices such as hard disks <sos> each block consists of a number of pages <sos> the pages are typically 512 [ 38 ] or 2048 or 4096 bytes in size <sos> associated with each page are a few bytes ( typically 1/32 of the data size ) that can be used for storage of an error correcting code ( ecc ) checksum <sos> typical block sizes include : <sos> 32 pages of 512+16 bytes each for a block size ( effective ) of 16 kb <sos> 64 pages of 2048+64 bytes each for a block size of 128 kb [ 39 ] <sos> 64 pages of 4096+128 bytes each for a block size of 256 kb [ 40 ] <sos> 128 pages of 4096+128 bytes each for a block size of 512 kb <sos> while reading and programming is performed on a page basis erasure can only be performed on a block basis [ 41 ] <sos> nand devices also require bad block management by the device driver software or by a separate controller chip <sos> sd cards for example include controller circuitry to perform bad block management and wear leveling <sos> when a logical block is accessed by high level software it is mapped to a physical block by the device driver or controller <sos> a number of blocks on the flash chip may be set aside for storing mapping tables to deal with bad blocks or the system may simply check each block at power up to create a bad block map in ram <sos> the overall memory capacity gradually shrinks as more blocks are marked as bad nand relies on ecc to compensate for bits that may spontaneously fail during normal device operation <sos> a typical ecc will correct a one bit error in each 2048 bits ( 256 bytes ) using 22 bits of ecc or a one bit error in each 4096 bits ( 512 bytes ) using 24 bits of ecc <sos> [ 42 ] if the ecc cannot correct the error during read it may still detect the error <sos> when doing erase or program operations the device can detect blocks that fail to program or erase and mark them bad <sos> the data is then written to a different good block and the bad block map is updated hamming codes are the most commonly used ecc for slc nand flash <sos> reed solomon codes and bose chaudhuri hocquenghem codes are commonly used ecc for mlc nand flash <sos> some mlc nand flash chips internally generate the appropriate bch error correction codes [ 36 ] <sos> most nand devices are shipped from the factory with some bad blocks <sos> these are typically marked according to a specified bad block marking strategy <sos> by allowing some bad blocks the manufacturers achieve far higher yields than would be possible if all blocks had to be verified good <sos> this significantly reduces nand flash costs and only slightly decreases the storage capacity of the parts <sos> when executing software from nand memories virtual memory strategies are often used : memory contents must first be paged or copied into memory mapped ram and executed there ( leading to the common combination of nand + ram ) <sos> a memory management unit ( mmu ) in the system is helpful but this can also be accomplished with overlays <sos> for this reason some systems will use a combination of nor and nand memories where a smaller nor memory is used as software rom and a larger nand memory is partitioned with a file system for use as a non volatile data storage area nand sacrifices the random access and execute in place advantages of nor <sos> nand is best suited to systems requiring high capacity data storage <sos> it offers higher densities larger capacities and lower cost <sos> it has faster erases sequential writes and sequential reads <sos> standardization [ edit ] <sos> a group called the open nand flash interface working group ( onfi ) has developed a standardized low level interface for nand flash chips <sos> this allows interoperability between conforming nand devices from different vendors <sos> the onfi specification version 10 [ 43 ] was released on 28 december 2006 <sos> it specifies : <sos> a standard physical interface ( pinout ) for nand flash in tsop 48 wsop 48 lga 52 and bga 63 packages <sos> a standard command set for reading writing and erasing nand flash chips <sos> a mechanism for self identification ( comparable to the serial presence detection feature of sdram memory modules ) <sos> the onfi group is supported by major nand flash manufacturers including hynix intel micron technology and numonyx as well as by major manufacturers of devices incorporating nand flash chips [ 44 ] <sos> two major flash device manufacturers toshiba and samsung have chosen to use an interface of their own design known as toggle mode ( and now toggle v20 ) <sos> this interface isn ' t pin to pin compatible with the onfi specification <sos> the result is a product designed for one vendor ' s devices may not be able to use another vendor ' s devices [ 45 ] <sos> a group of vendors including intel dell and microsoft formed a non volatile memory host controller interface ( nvmhci ) working group <sos> [ 46 ] the goal of the group is to provide standard software and hardware programming interfaces for nonvolatile memory subsystems including the "" flash cache "" device connected to the pci express bus <sos> distinction between nor and nand flash [ edit ] <sos> nor and nand flash differ in two important ways : <sos> the connections of the individual memory cells are different <sos> the interface provided for reading and writing the memory is different ( nor allows random access for reading nand allows only page access ) <sos> these two are linked by the design choices made in the development of nand flash <sos> a goal of nand flash development was to reduce the chip area required to implement a given capacity of flash memory and thereby to reduce cost per bit and increase maximum chip capacity so that flash memory could compete with magnetic storage devices like hard disks <sos> [ citation needed ] <sos> nor and nand flash get their names from the structure of the interconnections between memory cells <sos> [ 47 ] in nor flash cells are connected in parallel to the bit lines allowing cells to be read and programmed individually <sos> the parallel connection of cells resembles the parallel connection of transistors in a cmos nor gate <sos> in nand flash cells are connected in series resembling a nand gate <sos> the series connections consume less space than parallel ones reducing the cost of nand flash <sos> it does not by itself prevent nand cells from being read and programmed individually each nor flash cell is larger than a nand flash cell – 10 f2 vs 4 f2 – even when using exactly the same semiconductor device fabrication and so each transistor contact etc <sos> is exactly the same size – because nor flash cells require a separate metal contact for each cell [ 48 ] <sos> when nor flash was developed it was envisioned as a more economical and conveniently rewritable rom than contemporary eprom and eeprom memories <sos> thus random access reading circuitry was necessary <sos> however it was expected that nor flash rom would be read much more often than written so the write circuitry included was fairly slow and could erase only in a block wise fashion <sos> on the other hand applications that use flash as a replacement for disk drives do not require word level write address which would only add to the complexity and cost unnecessarily <sos> [ citation needed ] <sos> because of the series connection and removal of wordline contacts a large grid of nand flash memory cells will occupy perhaps only 60% of the area of equivalent nor cells [ 49 ] ( assuming the same cmos process resolution for example 130 nm 90 nm or 65 nm ) <sos> nand flash ' s designers realized that the area of a nand chip and thus the cost could be further reduced by removing the external address and data bus circuitry <sos> instead external devices could communicate with nand flash via sequential accessed command and data registers which would internally retrieve and output the necessary data <sos> this design choice made random access of nand flash memory impossible but the goal of nand flash was to replace mechanical hard disks not to replace roms <sos> attribute <sos> nand <sos> nor <sos>

design paradigms such as wear leveling and memory over provisioning the endurance of a storage system can be tuned to serve specific requirements [ 2 ] [ 56 ] <sos> in order to compute the longevity of the nand flash one must account for the size of the memory chip the type of memory ( eg <sos> slc/mlc/tlc ) and use pattern <sos> flash file systems [ edit ] <sos> main article : flash file system <sos> because of the particular characteristics of flash memory it is best used with either a controller to perform wear leveling and error correction or specifically designed flash file systems which spread writes over the media and deal with the long erase times of nor flash blocks <sos> [ 57 ] the basic concept behind flash file systems is the following : when the flash store is to be updated the file system will write a new copy of the changed data to a fresh block remap the file pointers then erase the old block later when it has time <sos> in practice flash file systems are used only for memory technology devices ( mtds ) which are embedded flash memories that do not have a controller <sos> removable flash memory cards and usb flash drives have built in controllers to perform wear leveling and error correction so use of a specific flash file system does not add any benefit capacity [ edit ] <sos> multiple chips are often arrayed to achieve higher capacities [ 58 ] for use in consumer electronic devices such as multimedia players or gpss <sos> the capacity of flash chips generally follows moore ' s law because they are manufactured with many of the same integrated circuits techniques and equipment consumer flash storage devices typically are advertised with usable sizes expressed as a small integer power of two ( 2 4 8 etc ) <sos> and a designation of megabytes ( mb ) or gigabytes ( gb ) ; eg 512 mb 8 gb <sos> this includes ssds marketed as hard drive replacements in accordance with traditional hard drives which use decimal prefixes <sos> [ 59 ] thus an ssd marked as “64 gb” is at least 64 × 10003 bytes ( 64 gb ) <sos> most users will have slightly less capacity than this available for their files due to the space taken by file system metadata <sos> the flash memory chips inside them are sized in strict binary multiples but the actual total capacity of the chips is not usable at the drive interface <sos> it is considerably larger than the advertised capacity in order to allow for distribution of writes ( wear leveling ) for sparing for error correction codes and for other metadata needed by the device ' s internal firmware <sos> in 2005 toshiba and sandisk developed a nand flash chip capable of storing 1 gb of data using multi level cell ( mlc ) technology capable of storing two bits of data per cell <sos> in september 2005 samsung electronics announced that it had developed the world’s first 2 gb chip [ 60 ] <sos> in march 2006 samsung announced flash hard drives with a capacity of 4 gb essentially the same order of magnitude as smaller laptop hard drives and in september 2006 samsung announced an 8 gb chip produced using a 40 nm manufacturing process <sos> [ 61 ] in january 2008 sandisk announced availability of their 16 gb microsdhc and 32 gb sdhc plus cards [ 62 ] [ 63 ] <sos> more recent flash drives ( as of 2012 ) have much greater capacities holding 64 128 and 256 gb [ 64 ] <sos> a joint development at intel and micron will allow the production of 32 layer 35 terabyte ( tb ) nand flash sticks and 10 tb standard sized ssds <sos> the device includes 5 packages of 16 × 48 gb tlc dies using a floating gate cell design [ 65 ] <sos> flash chips continue to be manufactured with capacities under or around 1 mb eg for bios roms and embedded applications <sos> in july 2016 samsung announced the 4tb samsung 850 evo which utilizes their 256 gb 48 layer tlc 3d v nand <sos> [ 66 ] in august 2016 samsung announced a 32 tb 25 inch sas ssd based on their 512 gb 64 layer tlc 3d v nand <sos> further samsung expects to unveil ssds with up to 100 tb of storage by 2020 [ 67 ] <sos> transfer rates [ edit ] <sos> flash memory devices are typically much faster at reading than writing <sos> [ 68 ] performance also depends on the quality of storage controllers which become more critical when devices are partially full <sos> [ 68 ] even when the only change to manufacturing is die shrink the absence of an appropriate controller can result in degraded speeds [ 69 ] <sos> applications [ edit ] <sos> serial flash [ edit ] <sos> serial flash : silicon storage tech sst25vf080b <sos> serial flash is a small low power flash memory that provides only serial access to the data rather than addressing individual bytes the user reads or writes large contiguous groups of bytes in the address space serially <sos> serial peripheral interface bus ( spi ) is a typical protocol for accessing the device <sos> when incorporated into an embedded system serial flash requires fewer wires on the pcb than parallel flash memories since it transmits and receives data one bit at a time <sos> this may permit a reduction in board space power consumption and total system cost <sos> there are several reasons why a serial device with fewer external pins than a parallel device can significantly reduce overall cost : <sos> many asics are pad limited meaning that the size of the die is constrained by the number of wire bond pads rather than the complexity and number of gates used for the device logic <sos> eliminating bond pads thus permits a more compact integrated circuit on a smaller die ; this increases the number of dies that may be fabricated on a wafer and thus reduces the cost per die reducing the number of external pins also reduces assembly and packaging costs <sos> a serial device may be packaged in a smaller and simpler package than a parallel device <sos> smaller and lower pin count packages occupy less pcb area lower pin count devices simplify pcb routing <sos> there are two major spi flash types <sos> the first type is characterized by small pages and one or more internal sram page buffers allowing a complete page to be read to the buffer partially modified and then written back ( for example the atmel at45 dataflash or the micron technology page erase nor flash ) <sos> the second type has larger sectors <sos> the smallest sectors typically found in an spi flash are 4 kb but they can be as large as 64 kb <sos> since the spi flash lacks an internal sram buffer the complete page must be read out and modified before being written back making it slow to manage <sos> spi flash is cheaper than dataflash and is therefore a good choice when the application is code shadowing <sos> the two types are not easily exchangeable since they do not have the same pinout and the command sets are incompatible firmware storage [ edit ] <sos> with the increasing speed of modern cpus parallel flash devices are often much slower than the memory bus of the computer they are connected to <sos> conversely modern sram offers access times below 10 ns while ddr2 sdram offers access times below 20 ns <sos> because of this it is often desirable to shadow code stored in flash into ram ; that is the code is copied from flash into ram before execution so that the cpu may access it at full speed <sos> device firmware may be stored in a serial flash device and then copied into sdram or sram when the device is powered up <sos> [ 70 ] using an external serial flash device rather than on chip flash removes the need for significant process compromise ( a process that is good for high speed logic is generally not good for flash and vice versa ) <sos> once it is decided to read the firmware in as one big block it is common to add compression to allow a smaller flash chip to be used <sos> typical applications for serial flash include storing firmware for hard drives ethernet controllers dsl modems wireless network devices etc <sos> flash memory as a replacement for hard drives [ edit ] <sos> main article : solid state drive <sos> one more recent application for flash memory is as a replacement for hard disks <sos> flash memory does not have the mechanical limitations and latencies of hard drives so a solid state drive ( ssd ) is attractive when considering speed noise power consumption and reliability <sos> flash drives are gaining traction as mobile device secondary storage devices ; they are also used as substitutes for hard drives in high performance desktop computers and some servers with raid and san architectures <sos> there remain some aspects of flash based ssds that make them unattractive <sos> the cost per gigabyte of flash memory remains significantly higher than that of hard disks <sos> [ 71 ] also flash memory has a finite number of p/e cycles but this seems to be currently under control since warranties on flash based ssds are approaching those of current hard drives <sos> [ 72 ] in addition deleted files on ssds can remain for an indefinite period of time before being overwritten by fresh data ; erasure or shred techniques or software that work well on magnetic hard disk drives have no effect on ssds compromising security and forensic examination for relational databases or other systems that require acid transactions even a modest amount of flash storage can offer vast speedups over arrays of disk drives [ 73 ] [ 74 ] <sos> in june 2006 samsung electronics released the first flash memory based pcs the q1 ssd and q30 ssd both of which used 32 gb ssds and were at least initially available only in south korea [ 75 ] <sos> a solid state drive was offered as an option with the first macbook air introduced in 2008 and from 2010 onwards all models shipped with an ssd <sos> starting in late 2011 as part of intel ' s ultrabook initiative an increasing number of ultra thin laptops are being shipped with ssds standard <sos> there are also hybrid techniques such as hybrid drive and readyboost that attempt to combine the advantages of both technologies using flash as a high speed non volatile cache for files on the disk that are often referenced but rarely modified such as application and operating system executable files <sos> flash memory as ram [ edit ] <sos> as of 2012 there are attempts to use flash memory as the main computer memory dram [ 76 ] <sos> archival or long term storage [ edit ] <sos> it is unclear how long flash memory will persist under archival conditions – ie benign temperature and humidity with infrequent access with or without prophylactic rewrite <sos> anecdotal evidence [ specify ] suggests that the technology is reasonably robust on the scale of years <sos> [ citation needed ] datasheets of atmel ' s flash based "" atmega "" microcontrollers typically promise retention times of 20 years at 85 °c and 100 years at 25 °c [ 77 ] <sos> an article from cmu in 2015 writes that "" today ' s flash devices which do not require flash refresh have a typical retention age of 1 year at room temperature "" <sos> and that temperature can lower the retention time exponentially <sos> the phenomenon can be modeled by arrhenius law [ 78 ] <sos> industry [ edit ] <sos> one source states that in 2008 the flash memory industry includes about us$91 billion in production and sales <sos> other sources put the flash memory market at a size of more than us$20 billion in 2006 accounting for more than eight percent of the overall semiconductor market and more than 34 percent of the total semiconductor memory market <sos> [ 79 ] in 2012 the market was estimated at $268 billion [ 80 ] <sos> flash scalability [ edit ] <sos> due to its relatively simple structure and high demand for higher capacity nand flash memory is the most aggressively scaled technology among electronic devices <sos> the heavy competition among the top few manufacturers only adds to the aggressiveness in shrinking the design rule or process technology node <sos> [ 31 ] while the expected shrink timeline is a

stacking of nand memory planes <sos> the decrease in endurance and increase in uncorrectable bit error rates that accompany feature size shrinking can be compensated by improved error correction mechanisms <sos> [ 83 ] even with these advances it may be impossible to economically scale flash to smaller and smaller dimensions as the number of electron holding capacity reduces <sos> many

flash memory is an electronic ( solid state ) non volatile computer storage medium that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed toshiba developed flash memory from eeprom ( electrically erasable programmable read only memory ) in the early 1980s and introduced it to the market in 1984 <sos> the two main types of flash memory are named after the nand and nor logic gates <sos> the individual flash memory cells exhibit internal characteristics similar to those of the corresponding gates <sos> while eproms had to be completely erased before being rewritten nand type flash memory may be written and read in blocks ( or pages ) which are generally much smaller than the entire device <sos> nor type flash allows a single machine word ( byte ) to be written – to an erased location – or read independently <sos> the nand type operates primarily in memory cards usb flash drives solid state drives ( those produced in 2009 or later ) and similar products for general storage and transfer of data <sos> nand or nor flash memory is also often used to store configuration data in numerous digital products a task previously made possible by eeprom or battery powered static ram <sos> one key disadvantage of flash memory is that it can only endure a relatively small number of write cycles in a specific block [ 1 ] <sos> example applications of both types of flash memory include personal computers pdas digital audio players digital cameras mobile phones synthesizers video games scientific instrumentation industrial robotics and medical electronics <sos> in addition to being non volatile flash memory offers fast read access times although not as fast as static ram or rom <sos> [ 2 ] its mechanical shock resistance helps explain its popularity over hard disks in portable devices as does its high durability ability to withstand high pressure temperature and immersion in water etc [ 3 ] <sos> although flash memory is technically a type of eeprom the term "" eeprom "" is generally used to refer specifically to non flash eeprom which is erasable in small blocks typically bytes <sos> [ citation needed ] because erase cycles are slow the large block sizes used in flash memory erasing give it a significant speed advantage over non flash eeprom when writing large amounts of data <sos> as of 2013 [ update ] [ needs update ? ] <sos> flash memory costs much less than

this template message ) <sos> flash memory ( both nor and nand types ) was invented by fujio masuoka while working for toshiba circa 1980 <sos> [ 4 ] [ 5 ] according to toshiba the name "" flash "" was suggested by masuoka ' s colleague shōji ariizumi because the erasure process of the memory contents reminded him of the flash of a camera <sos> [ 6 ] masuoka and colleagues presented the invention at the ieee 1987 international electron devices meeting ( iedm ) held in san francisco [ 7 ] <sos> intel corporation saw the massive potential of the invention and introduced the first commercial nor type flash chip in 1988 <sos> [ 8 ] nor based flash has long erase and write times but provides full address and data buses allowing random access to any memory location <sos> this makes it a suitable replacement for older read only memory ( rom ) chips which are used to store program code that rarely needs to be updated such as a computer ' s bios or the firmware of set top boxes <sos> its endurance may be from as little as 100 erase cycles for an on chip flash memory [ 9 ] to a more typical 10000 or 100000 erase cycles up to 1000000 erase cycles <sos> [ 10 ] nor based flash was the basis of early flash based removable media ; compactflash was originally based on it though later cards moved to less expensive nand flash nand flash has reduced erase and write times and requires less chip area per cell thus allowing greater storage density and lower cost per bit than nor flash ; it also has up to 10 times the endurance of nor flash <sos> however the i/o interface of nand flash does not provide a random access external address bus <sos> rather data must be read on a block wise basis with typical block sizes of hundreds to thousands of bits <sos> this makes nand flash unsuitable as a drop in replacement for program rom since most microprocessors and microcontrollers require byte level random access <sos> in this regard nand flash is similar to other secondary data storage devices such as hard disks and optical media and is thus highly suitable for use in mass storage devices such as memory cards <sos> the first nand based removable media format was smartmedia in 1995 and many others have followed including : <sos> multimediacard <sos> secure digital <sos> memory stick and xd picture card a new generation of memory card formats including rs mmc minisd and microsd feature extremely small form factors <sos> for example the microsd card has an area of just over 15 cm2 with a thickness of less than 1 mm <sos> as of august 2017 microsd cards with capacity up to 400gb are available [ 11 ] [ 12 ] <sos> principles of operation [ edit ] <sos> a flash memory cell <sos> flash memory stores information in an array of memory cells made from floating gate transistors <sos> in single level cell ( slc ) devices each cell stores only one bit of information <sos> multi level cell ( mlc ) devices including triple level cell ( tlc ) devices can store more than one bit per cell <sos> the floating gate may be conductive ( typically polysilicon in most kinds of flash memory ) or non conductive ( as in sonos flash memory ) [ 13 ] <sos> floating gate transistor [ edit ] <sos> main article : floating gate mosfet <sos> in flash memory each memory cell resembles a standard mosfet except that the transistor has two gates instead of one <sos> on top is the control gate ( cg ) as in other mos transistors but below this there is a floating gate ( fg ) insulated all around by an oxide layer <sos> the fg is interposed between the cg and the mosfet channel <sos> because the fg is electrically isolated by its insulating layer electrons placed on it are trapped until they are removed by another application of electric field ( eg <sos> applied voltage or uv as in eprom ) <sos> counter intuitively placing electrons on the fg sets the transistor to the logical "" 0 "" state <sos> once the fg is charged the electrons in it screen ( partially cancel ) the electric field from the cg thus increasing the threshold voltage ( vt1 ) of the cell <sos> this means that now a higher voltage ( vt2 ) must be applied to the cg to make the channel conductive <sos> in order to read a value from the transistor an intermediate voltage between the threshold voltages ( vt1 & vt2 ) is applied to the cg <sos> if the channel conducts at this intermediate voltage the fg must be uncharged ( if it was charged we would not get conduction because the intermediate voltage is less than vt2 ) and hence a logical "" 1 "" is stored in the gate <sos> if the channel does not conduct at the intermediate voltage it indicates that the fg is charged and hence a logical "" 0 "" is stored in the gate <sos> the presence of a logical "" 0 "" or "" 1 "" is sensed by determining whether there is current flowing through the transistor when the intermediate voltage is asserted on the cg <sos> in a multi level cell device which stores more than one bit per cell the amount of current flow is sensed ( rather than simply its presence or absence ) in order to determine more precisely the level of charge on the fg internal charge pumps [ edit ] <sos> despite the need for high programming and erasing voltages virtually all flash chips today require only a single supply voltage and produce the high voltages using on chip charge pumps over half the energy used by a 18 v nand flash chip is lost in the charge pump itself <sos> since boost converters are inherently more efficient than charge pumps researchers developing low power ssds have proposed returning to the dual vcc/vpp supply voltages used on all the early flash chips driving the high vpp voltage for all flash chips in a ssd with a single shared external boost converter [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] <sos> in spacecraft and other high radiation environments the on chip charge pump is the first part of the flash chip to fail although flash memories will continue to work – in read only mode – at much higher radiation levels [ 22 ] <sos> nor flash [ edit ] <sos> nor flash memory wiring and structure on silicon <sos> in nor flash each cell has one end connected directly to ground and the other end connected directly to a bit line <sos> this arrangement is called "" nor flash "" because it acts like a nor gate : when one of the word lines ( connected to the cell ' s cg ) is brought high the corresponding storage transistor acts to pull the output bit line low <sos> nor flash continues to be the technology of choice for embedded applications requiring a discrete non volatile memory device <sos> the low read latencies characteristic of nor devices allow for both direct code execution and data storage in a single memory product [ 23 ] <sos> programming [ edit ] <sos> programming a nor memory cell ( setting it to logical 0 ) via hot electron injection <sos> erasing a nor memory cell ( setting it to logical 1 ) via quantum tunneling <sos> a single level nor flash cell in its default state is logically equivalent to a binary "" 1 "" value because current will flow through the channel under application of an appropriate voltage to the control gate so that the bitline voltage is pulled down <sos> a nor flash cell can be programmed or set to a binary "" 0 "" value by the following procedure : <sos> an elevated on voltage ( typically >5 v ) is applied to the cg <sos> the channel is now turned on so electrons can flow from the source to the drain ( assuming an nmos transistor ) <sos> the source drain current is sufficiently high to cause some high energy electrons to jump through the insulating layer onto the fg via a process called hot electron injection erasing [ edit ] <sos> to erase a nor flash cell ( resetting it to the "" 1 "" state ) a large voltage of the opposite polarity is applied between the cg and source terminal pulling the electrons off the fg through quantum tunneling <sos> modern nor flash memory chips are divided into erase segments ( often called blocks or sectors ) <sos> the erase operation can be performed only on a block wise basis ; all the cells in an erase segment must be erased together <sos> programming of nor cells however generally can be performed one byte or word at a time nand flash memory wiring and structure on silicon <sos> nand flash [ edit ] <sos> nand flash also uses floating gate transistors but they are connected in a way that resembles a nand gate : several transistors are connected in series and the bit line is pulled low only if all the word lines are pulled high ( above the transistors ' vt ) <sos> these groups are then connected via some additional transistors to a nor style bit line array in the same way that single transistors are linked in nor flash <sos> compared to nor flash replacing single transistors with serial linked groups adds an extra level of addressing <sos> whereas nor flash might address memory by page then word nand flash might address it by page word and bit <sos> bit level addressing suits bit serial applications ( such as hard disk emulation ) which access only one bit at a time <sos> execute in place applications on the other hand require every bit in a word to be accessed simultaneously <sos> this requires word level addressing <sos> in any case both bit and word addressing modes are possible with either nor or nand flash to read data first the desired group is selected ( in the same way that a single transistor is selected from a nor array ) <sos> next most of the word lines are pulled up above the vt of a programmed bit while one of them is pulled up to just over the vt of an erased bit <sos> the series group will conduct ( and pull the bit line low ) if the selected bit has not been programmed <sos> despite the additional transistors the reduction in ground wires and bit lines allows a denser layout and greater storage capacity per chip <sos> ( the ground wires and bit lines are actually much wider than the lines in the diagrams ) <sos> in addition nand flash is typically permitted to contain a certain number of faults ( nor flash as is used for a bios rom is expected to be fault free ) <sos> manufacturers try to maximize the amount of usable storage by shrinking the size of the transistors <sos> writing and erasing [ edit ] <sos> nand flash uses tunnel injection for writing and tunnel release for erasing <sos> nand flash memory forms the core of the removable usb storage devices known as usb flash drives as well as most memory card formats and solid state drives available today vertical nand [ edit ] <sos> vertical nand ( v nand ) memory stacks memory cells vertically and uses a charge trap flash architecture <sos> the vertical layers allow larger areal bit densities without requiring smaller individual cells [ 24 ] <sos> structure [ edit ] <sos> v nand uses a charge trap flash geometry ( pioneered in 2002 by amd ) [ citation needed ] that stores charge on an embedded silicon nitride film <sos> such a film is more robust against point defects and can be made thicker to hold larger numbers of electrons <sos> v nand wraps a planar charge trap cell into a cylindrical form [ 24 ] <sos> an individual memory cell is made up of one planar polysilicon layer containing a hole filled by multiple concentric vertical cylinders <sos> the hole ' s polysilicon surface acts as the gate electrode <sos> the outermost silicon dioxide cylinder acts as the gate dielectric enclosing a silicon nitride cylinder that stores charge in turn enclosing a silicon dioxide cylinder as the tunnel dielectric that surrounds a central rod of conducting polysilicon which acts as the conducting channel [ 24 ] <sos> memory cells in different vertical layers do not interfere with each other as the charges cannot move vertically through the silicon nitride storage medium and the electric fields associated with the gates are closely confined within each layer <sos> the vertical collection is electrically identical to the serial linked groups in which conventional nand flash memory is configured [ 24 ] <sos> construction [ edit ] <sos> growth of a group of v nand cells begins with an alternating stack of conducting ( doped ) polysilicon layers and insulating silicon dioxide layers [ 24 ] <sos> the next step is to form a cylindrical hole through these layers <sos> in practice a 128 gibit v nand chip with 24 layers of memory cells requires about 29 billion such holes <sos> next the hole ' s inner surface receives multiple coatings first silicon dioxide then silicon nitride then a second layer of silicon dioxide <sos> finally the hole is filled with conducting ( doped ) polysilicon [ 24 ] <sos> performance [ edit ] <sos> as of 2013 v nand flash architecture allows read and write operations twice as fast as conventional nand and can last up to 10 times as long while consuming 50 percent less power <sos> they offer comparable physical bit density using 10 nm lithography but may be able to increase bit density by up to two orders of magnitude [ 24 ] <sos> limitations [ edit ] <sos> block erasure [ edit ] <sos> one limitation of flash memory is that although it can be read or programmed a byte or a word at a time in a random access fashion it can be erased only a block at a time <sos> this generally sets all bits in the block to 1 <sos> starting with a freshly erased block any location within that block can be programmed <sos> however once a bit has been set to 0 only by erasing the entire block can it be changed back to 1 <sos> in other words flash memory ( specifically nor flash ) offers random access read and programming operations but does not offer arbitrary random access rewrite or erase operations <sos> a location can however be rewritten as long as the new value ' s 0 bits are a superset of the over written values <sos> for example a nibble value may be erased to 1111 then written as 1110 <sos> successive writes to that nibble can change it to 1010 then 0010 and finally 0000 <sos> essentially erasure sets all bits to 1 and programming can only clear bits to 0 <sos> file systems designed for flash devices can make use of this capability for example to represent sector metadata <sos> although data structures in flash memory cannot be updated in completely general ways this allows members to be "" removed "" by marking them as invalid <sos> this technique may need to be modified for multi level cell devices where one memory cell holds more than one bit common flash devices such as usb flash drives and memory cards provide only a block level interface or flash translation layer ( ftl ) which writes to a different cell each time to wear level the device <sos> this prevents incremental writing within a block ; however it does help the device from being prematurely worn out by intensive write patterns memory wear [ edit ] <sos> another limitation is that flash memory has a finite number of program – erase cycles ( typically written as p/e cycles ) <sos> most commercially available flash products are guaranteed to withstand around 100000 p/e cycles before the wear begins to deteriorate the integrity of the storage <sos> [ 25 ] micron technology and sun microsystems announced an slc nand flash memory chip rated for 1000000 p/e cycles on 17 december 2008 [ 26 ] <sos> the guaranteed cycle count may apply only to block zero ( as is the case with tsop nand devices ) or to all blocks ( as in nor ) <sos> this effect is mitigated in some chip firmware or file system drivers by counting the writes and dynamically remapping blocks in order to spread write operations between sectors ; this technique is called wear leveling <sos> another approach is to perform write verification and remapping to spare sectors in case of write failure a technique called bad block management ( bbm ) <sos> for portable consumer devices these wearout management techniques typically extend the life of the flash memory beyond the life of the device itself and some data loss may be acceptable in these applications <sos> for high reliability data storage however it is not advisable to use flash memory that would have to go through a large number of programming cycles <sos> this limitation is meaningless for ' read only ' applications such as thin clients and routers which are programmed only once or at most a few times during their lifetimes <sos> in december 2012 taiwanese engineers from macronix revealed their intention to announce at the 2012 ieee international electron devices meeting that they had figured out how to improve nand flash storage read/write cycles from 10000 to 100 million cycles using a "" self healing "" process that used a flash chip with "" onboard heaters that could anneal small groups of memory cells <sos> "" [ 27 ] the built in thermal annealing was to replace the usual erase cycle with a local high temperature process that not only erased the stored charge but also repaired the electron induced stress in the chip giving write cycles of at least 100 million <sos> [ 28 ] the result was to be a chip that could be erased and rewritten over and over even when it should theoretically break down <sos> as promising as macronix’s breakthrough might have been for the mobile industry however there were no plans for a commercial product to be released any time in the near future [ 29 ] <sos> read disturb [ edit ] <sos> the method used to read nand flash memory can cause nearby cells in the same memory block to change over time ( become programmed ) <sos> this is known as read disturb <sos> the threshold number of reads is generally in the hundreds of thousands of reads between intervening erase operations <sos> if reading continually from one cell that cell will not fail but rather one of the surrounding cells on a subsequent read <sos> to avoid the read disturb problem the flash controller will typically count the total number of reads to a block since the last erase <sos> when the count exceeds a target limit the affected block is copied over to a new block erased then released to the block pool <sos> the original block is as good as new after the erase <sos> if the flash controller does not intervene in time however a read disturb error will occur with possible data loss if the errors are too numerous to correct with an error correcting code [ 30 ] [ 31 ] <sos> x ray effects [ edit ] <sos> most flash ics come in ball grid array ( bga ) packages and even the ones that do not are often mounted on a pcb next to other bga packages <sos> after pcb assembly boards with bga packages are often x rayed to see if the balls are making proper connections to the proper pad or if the bga needs rework <sos> these x rays can erase programmed bits in a flash chip ( convert programmed "" 0 "" bits into erased "" 1 "" bits ) <sos> erased bits ( "" 1 "" bits ) are not affected by x rays [ 32 ] [ 33 ] <sos> some manufacturers are now making x ray proof sd [ 34 ] and usb [ 35 ] memory devices low level access [ edit ] <sos> the low level interface to flash memory chips differs from those of other memory types such as dram rom and eeprom which support bit alterability ( both zero to one and one to zero ) and random access via externally accessible address buses <sos> nor memory has an external address bus for reading and programming <sos> for nor memory reading and programming are random access and unlocking and erasing are block wise <sos> for nand memory reading and programming are page wise and unlocking and erasing are block wise <sos> nor memories [ edit ] <sos> nor flash by intel <sos> reading from nor flash is similar to reading from random access memory provided the address and data bus are mapped correctly <sos> because of this most microprocessors can use nor flash memory as execute in place ( xip ) memory meaning that programs stored in nor flash can be executed directly from the nor flash without needing to be copied into ram first <sos> nor flash may be programmed in a random access manner similar to reading <sos> programming changes bits from a logical one to a zero <sos> bits that are already zero are left unchanged <sos> erasure must happen a block at a time and resets all the bits in the erased block back to one <sos> typical block sizes are 64 128 or 256 kib bad block management is a relatively new feature in nor chips <sos> in older nor devices not supporting bad block management the software or device driver controlling the memory chip must correct for blocks that wear out or the device will cease to work reliably <sos> the specific commands used to lock unlock program or erase nor memories differ for each manufacturer <sos> to avoid needing unique driver software for every device made special common flash memory interface ( cfi ) commands allow the device to identify itself and its critical operating parameters <sos> besides its use as random access rom nor flash can also be used as a storage device by taking advantage of random access programming <sos> some devices offer read while write functionality so that code continues to execute even while a program or erase operation is occurring in the background <sos> for sequential data writes nor flash chips typically have slow write speeds compared with nand flash <sos> typical nor flash does not need an error correcting code [ 36 ] <sos> nand memories [ edit ] <sos> nand flash architecture was introduced by toshiba in 1989 <sos> [ 37 ] these memories are accessed much like block devices such as hard disks <sos> each block consists of a number of pages <sos> the pages are typically 512 [ 38 ] or 2048 or 4096 bytes in size <sos> associated with each page are a few bytes ( typically 1/32 of the data size ) that can be used for storage of an error correcting code ( ecc ) checksum <sos> typical block sizes include : <sos> 32 pages of 512+16 bytes each for a block size ( effective ) of 16 kb <sos> 64 pages of 2048+64 bytes each for a block size of 128 kb [ 39 ] <sos> 64 pages of 4096+128 bytes each for a block size of 256 kb [ 40 ] <sos> 128 pages of 4096+128 bytes each for a block size of 512 kb <sos> while reading and programming is performed on a page basis erasure can only be performed on a block basis [ 41 ] <sos> nand devices also require bad block management by the device driver software or by a separate controller chip <sos> sd cards for example include controller circuitry to perform bad block management and wear leveling <sos> when a logical block is accessed by high level software it is mapped to a physical block by the device driver or controller <sos> a number of blocks on the flash chip may be set aside for storing mapping tables to deal with bad blocks or the system may simply check each block at power up to create a bad block map in ram <sos> the overall memory capacity gradually shrinks as more blocks are marked as bad nand relies on ecc to compensate for bits that may spontaneously fail during normal device operation <sos> a typical ecc will correct a one bit error in each 2048 bits ( 256 bytes ) using 22 bits of ecc or a one bit error in each 4096 bits ( 512 bytes ) using 24 bits of ecc <sos> [ 42 ] if the ecc cannot correct the error during read it may still detect the error <sos> when doing erase or program operations the device can detect blocks that fail to program or erase and mark them bad <sos> the data is then written to a different good block and the bad block map is updated hamming codes are the most commonly used ecc for slc nand flash <sos> reed solomon codes and bose chaudhuri hocquenghem codes are commonly used ecc for mlc nand flash <sos> some mlc nand flash chips internally generate the appropriate bch error correction codes [ 36 ] <sos> most nand devices are shipped from the factory with some bad blocks <sos> these are typically marked according to a specified bad block marking strategy <sos> by allowing some bad blocks the manufacturers achieve far higher yields than would be possible if all blocks had to be verified good <sos> this significantly reduces nand flash costs and only slightly decreases the storage capacity of the parts <sos> when executing software from nand memories virtual memory strategies are often used : memory contents must first be paged or copied into memory mapped ram and executed there ( leading to the common combination of nand + ram ) <sos> a memory management unit ( mmu ) in the system is helpful but this can also be accomplished with overlays <sos> for this reason some systems will use a combination of nor and nand memories where a smaller nor memory is used as software rom and a larger nand memory is partitioned with a file system for use as a non volatile data storage area nand sacrifices the random access and execute in place advantages of nor <sos> nand is best suited to systems requiring high capacity data storage <sos> it offers higher densities larger capacities and lower cost <sos> it has faster erases sequential writes and sequential reads <sos> standardization [ edit ] <sos> a group called the open nand flash interface working group ( onfi ) has developed a standardized low level interface for nand flash chips <sos> this allows interoperability between conforming nand devices from different vendors <sos> the onfi specification version 10 [ 43 ] was released on 28 december 2006 <sos> it specifies : <sos> a standard physical interface ( pinout ) for nand flash in tsop 48 wsop 48 lga 52 and bga 63 packages <sos> a standard command set for reading writing and erasing nand flash chips <sos> a mechanism for self identification ( comparable to the serial presence detection feature of sdram memory modules ) <sos> the onfi group is supported by major nand flash manufacturers including hynix intel micron technology and numonyx as well as by major manufacturers of devices incorporating nand flash chips [ 44 ] <sos> two major flash device manufacturers toshiba and samsung have chosen to use an interface of their own design known as toggle mode ( and now toggle v20 ) <sos> this interface isn ' t pin to pin compatible with the onfi specification <sos> the result is a product designed for one vendor ' s devices may not be able to use another vendor ' s devices [ 45 ] <sos> a group of vendors including intel dell and microsoft formed a non volatile memory host controller interface ( nvmhci ) working group <sos> [ 46 ] the goal of the group is to provide standard software and hardware programming interfaces for nonvolatile memory subsystems including the "" flash cache "" device connected to the pci express bus <sos> distinction between nor and nand flash [ edit ] <sos> nor and nand flash differ in two important ways : <sos> the connections of the individual memory cells are different <sos> the interface provided for reading and writing the memory is different ( nor allows random access for reading nand allows only page access ) <sos> these two are linked by the design choices made in the development of nand flash <sos> a goal of nand flash development was to reduce the chip area required to implement a given capacity of flash memory and thereby to reduce cost per bit and increase maximum chip capacity so that flash memory could compete with magnetic storage devices like hard disks <sos> [ citation needed ] <sos> nor and nand flash get their names from the structure of the interconnections between memory cells <sos> [ 47 ] in nor flash cells are connected in parallel to the bit lines allowing cells to be read and programmed individually <sos> the parallel connection of cells resembles the parallel connection of transistors in a cmos nor gate <sos> in nand flash cells are connected in series resembling a nand gate <sos> the series connections consume less space than parallel ones reducing the cost of nand flash <sos> it does not by itself prevent nand cells from being read and programmed individually each nor flash cell is larger than a nand flash cell – 10 f2 vs 4 f2 – even when using exactly the same semiconductor device fabrication and so each transistor contact etc <sos> is exactly the same size – because nor flash cells require a separate metal contact for each cell [ 48 ] <sos> when nor flash was developed it was envisioned as a more economical and conveniently rewritable rom than contemporary eprom and eeprom memories <sos> thus random access reading circuitry was necessary <sos> however it was expected that nor flash rom would be read much more often than written so the write circuitry included was fairly slow and could erase only in a block wise fashion <sos> on the other hand applications that use flash as a replacement for disk drives do not require word level write address which would only add to the complexity and cost unnecessarily <sos> [ citation needed ] <sos> because of the series connection and removal of wordline contacts a large grid of nand flash memory cells will occupy perhaps only 60% of the area of equivalent nor cells [ 49 ] ( assuming the same cmos process resolution for example 130 nm 90 nm or 65 nm ) <sos> nand flash ' s designers realized that the area of a nand chip and thus the cost could be further reduced by removing the external address and data bus circuitry <sos> instead external devices could communicate with nand flash via sequential accessed command and data registers which would internally retrieve and output the necessary data <sos> this design choice made random access of nand flash memory impossible but the goal of nand flash was to replace mechanical hard disks not to replace roms <sos> attribute <sos> nand <sos> nor <sos>

design paradigms such as wear leveling and memory over provisioning the endurance of a storage system can be tuned to serve specific requirements [ 2 ] [ 56 ] <sos> in order to compute the longevity of the nand flash one must account for the size of the memory chip the type of memory ( eg <sos> slc/mlc/tlc ) and use pattern <sos> flash file systems [ edit ] <sos> main article : flash file system <sos> because of the particular characteristics of flash memory it is best used with either a controller to perform wear leveling and error correction or specifically designed flash file systems which spread writes over the media and deal with the long erase times of nor flash blocks <sos> [ 57 ] the basic concept behind flash file systems is the following : when the flash store is to be updated the file system will write a new copy of the changed data to a fresh block remap the file pointers then erase the old block later when it has time <sos> in practice flash file systems are used only for memory technology devices ( mtds ) which are embedded flash memories that do not have a controller <sos> removable flash memory cards and usb flash drives have built in controllers to perform wear leveling and error correction so use of a specific flash file system does not add any benefit capacity [ edit ] <sos> multiple chips are often arrayed to achieve higher capacities [ 58 ] for use in consumer electronic devices such as multimedia players or gpss <sos> the capacity of flash chips generally follows moore ' s law because they are manufactured with many of the same integrated circuits techniques and equipment consumer flash storage devices typically are advertised with usable sizes expressed as a small integer power of two ( 2 4 8 etc ) <sos> and a designation of megabytes ( mb ) or gigabytes ( gb ) ; eg 512 mb 8 gb <sos> this includes ssds marketed as hard drive replacements in accordance with traditional hard drives which use decimal prefixes <sos> [ 59 ] thus an ssd marked as “64 gb” is at least 64 × 10003 bytes ( 64 gb ) <sos> most users will have slightly less capacity than this available for their files due to the space taken by file system metadata <sos> the flash memory chips inside them are sized in strict binary multiples but the actual total capacity of the chips is not usable at the drive interface <sos> it is considerably larger than the advertised capacity in order to allow for distribution of writes ( wear leveling ) for sparing for error correction codes and for other metadata needed by the device ' s internal firmware <sos> in 2005 toshiba and sandisk developed a nand flash chip capable of storing 1 gb of data using multi level cell ( mlc ) technology capable of storing two bits of data per cell <sos> in september 2005 samsung electronics announced that it had developed the world’s first 2 gb chip [ 60 ] <sos> in march 2006 samsung announced flash hard drives with a capacity of 4 gb essentially the same order of magnitude as smaller laptop hard drives and in september 2006 samsung announced an 8 gb chip produced using a 40 nm manufacturing process <sos> [ 61 ] in january 2008 sandisk announced availability of their 16 gb microsdhc and 32 gb sdhc plus cards [ 62 ] [ 63 ] <sos> more recent flash drives ( as of 2012 ) have much greater capacities holding 64 128 and 256 gb [ 64 ] <sos> a joint development at intel and micron will allow the production of 32 layer 35 terabyte ( tb ) nand flash sticks and 10 tb standard sized ssds <sos> the device includes 5 packages of 16 × 48 gb tlc dies using a floating gate cell design [ 65 ] <sos> flash chips continue to be manufactured with capacities under or around 1 mb eg for bios roms and embedded applications <sos> in july 2016 samsung announced the 4tb samsung 850 evo which utilizes their 256 gb 48 layer tlc 3d v nand <sos> [ 66 ] in august 2016 samsung announced a 32 tb 25 inch sas ssd based on their 512 gb 64 layer tlc 3d v nand <sos> further samsung expects to unveil ssds with up to 100 tb of storage by 2020 [ 67 ] <sos> transfer rates [ edit ] <sos> flash memory devices are typically much faster at reading than writing <sos> [ 68 ] performance also depends on the quality of storage controllers which become more critical when devices are partially full <sos> [ 68 ] even when the only change to manufacturing is die shrink the absence of an appropriate controller can result in degraded speeds [ 69 ] <sos> applications [ edit ] <sos> serial flash [ edit ] <sos> serial flash : silicon storage tech sst25vf080b <sos> serial flash is a small low power flash memory that provides only serial access to the data rather than addressing individual bytes the user reads or writes large contiguous groups of bytes in the address space serially <sos> serial peripheral interface bus ( spi ) is a typical protocol for accessing the device <sos> when incorporated into an embedded system serial flash requires fewer wires on the pcb than parallel flash memories since it transmits and receives data one bit at a time <sos> this may permit a reduction in board space power consumption and total system cost <sos> there are several reasons why a serial device with fewer external pins than a parallel device can significantly reduce overall cost : <sos> many asics are pad limited meaning that the size of the die is constrained by the number of wire bond pads rather than the complexity and number of gates used for the device logic <sos> eliminating bond pads thus permits a more compact integrated circuit on a smaller die ; this increases the number of dies that may be fabricated on a wafer and thus reduces the cost per die reducing the number of external pins also reduces assembly and packaging costs <sos> a serial device may be packaged in a smaller and simpler package than a parallel device <sos> smaller and lower pin count packages occupy less pcb area lower pin count devices simplify pcb routing <sos> there are two major spi flash types <sos> the first type is characterized by small pages and one or more internal sram page buffers allowing a complete page to be read to the buffer partially modified and then written back ( for example the atmel at45 dataflash or the micron technology page erase nor flash ) <sos> the second type has larger sectors <sos> the smallest sectors typically found in an spi flash are 4 kb but they can be as large as 64 kb <sos> since the spi flash lacks an internal sram buffer the complete page must be read out and modified before being written back making it slow to manage <sos> spi flash is cheaper than dataflash and is therefore a good choice when the application is code shadowing <sos> the two types are not easily exchangeable since they do not have the same pinout and the command sets are incompatible firmware storage [ edit ] <sos> with the increasing speed of modern cpus parallel flash devices are often much slower than the memory bus of the computer they are connected to <sos> conversely modern sram offers access times below 10 ns while ddr2 sdram offers access times below 20 ns <sos> because of this it is often desirable to shadow code stored in flash into ram ; that is the code is copied from flash into ram before execution so that the cpu may access it at full speed <sos> device firmware may be stored in a serial flash device and then copied into sdram or sram when the device is powered up <sos> [ 70 ] using an external serial flash device rather than on chip flash removes the need for significant process compromise ( a process that is good for high speed logic is generally not good for flash and vice versa ) <sos> once it is decided to read the firmware in as one big block it is common to add compression to allow a smaller flash chip to be used <sos> typical applications for serial flash include storing firmware for hard drives ethernet controllers dsl modems wireless network devices etc <sos> flash memory as a replacement for hard drives [ edit ] <sos> main article : solid state drive <sos> one more recent application for flash memory is as a replacement for hard disks <sos> flash memory does not have the mechanical limitations and latencies of hard drives so a solid state drive ( ssd ) is attractive when considering speed noise power consumption and reliability <sos> flash drives are gaining traction as mobile device secondary storage devices ; they are also used as substitutes for hard drives in high performance desktop computers and some servers with raid and san architectures <sos> there remain some aspects of flash based ssds that make them unattractive <sos> the cost per gigabyte of flash memory remains significantly higher than that of hard disks <sos> [ 71 ] also flash memory has a finite number of p/e cycles but this seems to be currently under control since warranties on flash based ssds are approaching those of current hard drives <sos> [ 72 ] in addition deleted files on ssds can remain for an indefinite period of time before being overwritten by fresh data ; erasure or shred techniques or software that work well on magnetic hard disk drives have no effect on ssds compromising security and forensic examination for relational databases or other systems that require acid transactions even a modest amount of flash storage can offer vast speedups over arrays of disk drives [ 73 ] [ 74 ] <sos> in june 2006 samsung electronics released the first flash memory based pcs the q1 ssd and q30 ssd both of which used 32 gb ssds and were at least initially available only in south korea [ 75 ] <sos> a solid state drive was offered as an option with the first macbook air introduced in 2008 and from 2010 onwards all models shipped with an ssd <sos> starting in late 2011 as part of intel ' s ultrabook initiative an increasing number of ultra thin laptops are being shipped with ssds standard <sos> there are also hybrid techniques such as hybrid drive and readyboost that attempt to combine the advantages of both technologies using flash as a high speed non volatile cache for files on the disk that are often referenced but rarely modified such as application and operating system executable files <sos> flash memory as ram [ edit ] <sos> as of 2012 there are attempts to use flash memory as the main computer memory dram [ 76 ] <sos> archival or long term storage [ edit ] <sos> it is unclear how long flash memory will persist under archival conditions – ie benign temperature and humidity with infrequent access with or without prophylactic rewrite <sos> anecdotal evidence [ specify ] suggests that the technology is reasonably robust on the scale of years <sos> [ citation needed ] datasheets of atmel ' s flash based "" atmega "" microcontrollers typically promise retention times of 20 years at 85 °c and 100 years at 25 °c [ 77 ] <sos> an article from cmu in 2015 writes that "" today ' s flash devices which do not require flash refresh have a typical retention age of 1 year at room temperature "" <sos> and that temperature can lower the retention time exponentially <sos> the phenomenon can be modeled by arrhenius law [ 78 ] <sos> industry [ edit ] <sos> one source states that in 2008 the flash memory industry includes about us$91 billion in production and sales <sos> other sources put the flash memory market at a size of more than us$20 billion in 2006 accounting for more than eight percent of the overall semiconductor market and more than 34 percent of the total semiconductor memory market <sos> [ 79 ] in 2012 the market was estimated at $268 billion [ 80 ] <sos> flash scalability [ edit ] <sos> due to its relatively simple structure and high demand for higher capacity nand flash memory is the most aggressively scaled technology among electronic devices <sos> the heavy competition among the top few manufacturers only adds to the aggressiveness in shrinking the design rule or process technology node <sos> [ 31 ] while the expected shrink timeline is a

stacking of nand memory planes <sos> the decrease in endurance and increase in uncorrectable bit error rates that accompany feature size shrinking can be compensated by improved error correction mechanisms <sos> [ 83 ] even with these advances it may be impossible to economically scale flash to smaller and smaller dimensions as the number of electron holding capacity reduces <sos> many

still commonly used as geographical references <sos> the boundaries have changed over time with the most significant in 1658 ( the cession of provinces from denmark norway to sweden ) and 1812 ( due to the loss of finland to russia in 1809 ) <sos> in 1812 some provinces were moved from götaland to svealand finland [ edit ] <sos> after the finnish war sweden was forced to cede the counties in finland to russia following the treaty of fredrikshamn in ( 1809 ) <sos> however the counties were upheld in finland until a reform in 1997 <sos> they are still in use in sweden 370 years later <sos> the counties in finland established in 1634 were : turku and pori county nyland and tavastehus county viborg and nyslott county ostrobothnia county and kexholm county <sos> over time the number of

history [ edit ] <sos> older subdivisions [ edit ] <sos> sweden ' s provinces or landskap and the "" lands "" or landsdelar lack political importance today but are common denominations culturally and historically <sos> the provinces had their own laws and justice systems and could have large cultural and religious differences <sos> note that the province of småland ( literally small land ) historically was several provinces with its own laws <sos> here burial tradition in the era before the viking age could differ significantly from province to province <sos> the province of norrbotten is a relatively recent creation ; it was part of västerbotten which extended all the way to österbotten into today ' s finland before 1809 <sos> finnish and swedish lappland was also one province until 1809 <sos> historically the provinces were grouped in three lands : götaland being southern and western sweden ; svealand being eastern and south eastern and norrland being the entire northern half <sos> the names of the first two refer to ancient tribes and the third is a geographical reference <sos> they are still commonly used as geographical references <sos> the boundaries have changed over time with the most significant in 1658 ( the cession of provinces from denmark norway to sweden ) and 1812 ( due to the loss of finland to russia in 1809 ) <sos> in 1812 some provinces were moved from götaland to svealand finland [ edit ] <sos> after the finnish war sweden was forced to cede the counties in finland to russia following the treaty of fredrikshamn in ( 1809 ) <sos> however the counties were upheld in finland until a reform in 1997 <sos> they are still in use in sweden 370 years later <sos> the counties in finland established in 1634 were : turku and pori county nyland and tavastehus county viborg and nyslott county ostrobothnia county and kexholm county <sos> over time the number of subdivisions in finland increased to twelve until a reorganization in 1997 reduced their number to six provinces while keeping the administrative model intact <sos> the counties in finland were abolished in 2010 <sos> abolished counties [ edit ] <sos> abolished counties in current day sweden proper were : <sos> skaraborg county + gothenburg and bohus county + älvsborg county ( merged as västra götaland county in 1998 ) <sos> kopparberg county ( became dalarna county in 1997 )

or landsdelar lack political importance today but are common denominations culturally and historically <sos> the provinces had their own laws and justice systems and could have large cultural and religious differences <sos> note that the province of småland ( literally small land ) historically was several provinces with its own laws <sos> here burial tradition in the era before the viking age could differ significantly from province to province <sos> the province of norrbotten is a relatively recent creation ; it was part of västerbotten which extended all the way to österbotten into today ' s finland before 1809 <sos> finnish and swedish lappland was also one province until 1809 <sos> historically the provinces were grouped in three lands : götaland being southern and western sweden ; svealand being eastern and south eastern and norrland being the entire northern half <sos> the names of the first two refer to ancient tribes and the third is a geographical reference <sos> they are still commonly used as geographical references <sos> the boundaries have changed over time with the most significant in 1658 ( the cession of provinces from denmark norway to sweden ) and 1812 ( due to the loss of finland to russia in 1809 ) <sos> in 1812 some provinces were moved from götaland to svealand finland [ edit ] <sos> after the finnish war sweden was forced to cede the counties in finland to russia following the treaty of fredrikshamn in ( 1809 ) <sos> however the counties were upheld in finland until a reform in 1997 <sos> they are still in use in sweden 370 years later <sos> the counties in finland established in 1634 were : turku and pori county nyland and tavastehus county viborg and nyslott county ostrobothnia county and kexholm county <sos> over time the number of subdivisions in finland increased to twelve until a reorganization in 1997 reduced their number to six provinces while keeping the administrative model intact <sos> the counties in finland were abolished in 2010 <sos> abolished counties [ edit ] <sos> abolished counties in current day sweden proper were : <sos> skaraborg county + gothenburg and bohus county + älvsborg county ( merged as västra götaland county in 1998 ) <sos> kopparberg county ( became dalarna county in 1997 ) <sos> malmöhus county + kristianstad county ( merged as skåne county in 1997 ) <sos> norrland county ( in 1645 divided into västerbotten county hudiksvall county and härnösand county ) <sos> nyköping county gripsholm county and eskilstunahus county ( united in 1683 to become södermanland county ) <sos> närke county ( became örebro county ) <sos> härnösand county ( 1645–1654 formed västernorrland county ) <sos> hudiksvall county ( 1645–1654 formed gävleborg county ) <sos> stockholm

counties in swedish ruled finland were : <sos> turku and pori county ( 1634–1809 ) <sos> nyland and tavastehus county ( 1634–1809 ) <sos> ostrobothnia county ( 1634–1775 ) <sos> viborg and nyslott

aegis of the swedish government ansvarskommittén has been investigating the possibilities of merging the current 21 counties into 6 to 9 larger regions <sos> these proposals are from their final report delivered in 2007 : [ 2 ] <sos> norra sverige : norrbotten county + västerbotten county + jämtland county + västernorrland county + nordanstig and hudiksvall <sos> bergslagen : the rest of gävleborg county + dalarna county + örebro county + värmland county <sos> mälardalen : stockholm county + uppsala county + södermanland county + västmanland county + gotland county <sos> västra götaland : västra götaland county + halland county <sos> östra götaland : östergötland county + jönköping county + kronoberg county + kalmar county <sos> södra götaland : skåne county + blekinge county <sos> norra sverige : norrbotten county + västerbotten county + örnsköldsvik <sos> mellannorrland : jämtland county + västernorrland county ( except örnsköldsvik ) + nordanstig and hudiksvall <sos> dalarna gävleborg : dalarna county + gävleborg county ( except nordanstig and hudiksvall ) <sos> västra svealand : värmland county + örebro county <sos> mälardalen : stockholm county + uppsala county + södermanland county + västmanland county + gotland county <sos> västra götaland : västra götaland county + halland county <sos> östergötland : östergötland county + västervik <sos> småland : jönköping county + kronoberg county + kalmar county ( except västervik ) <sos> södra götaland : skåne county + blekinge county <sos> a model for this comes from the merger of some counties into skåne county and västra götaland county in 1997 and 1998 respectively which is now considered a success <sos> the counties are discussing the proposal <sos> an obstacle is that stockholm county does not want to merge with any other county while its neighbours want to merge with stockholm <sos> after this discussion the following proposal has in 2016 emerged : <sos> norrbotten västerbotten västernorrland and jämtland county <sos> dalarna gävleborgs södermanlands uppsala västmanland and örebro county <sos> östergötland jönköping kalmar and kronoberg county <sos> gotland and stockholm county <sos> halland värmland and västra götaland county <sos> blekinge and skåne county <sos> the main difference is that the proposed berglagen is divided to other counties and stockholm is on its own ( plus the small gotland which has air connections to stockholm ) <sos> riksområden [ edit ] <sos> main article : national areas of sweden <sos> current statistical regions ( riksområden ) <sos> the counties in sweden correspond to the third level of division in the european union ' s system of nomenclature of territorial units for statistics <sos> for the purpose of creating regions

when present <sos> in jazz and other popular music ensembles the pianist bassist drummer and sometimes the guitarist are referred to as the rhythm section <sos> most classical pieces written for full orchestra since the time of haydn and mozart are orchestrated to place emphasis on the strings woodwinds and brass <sos> however often at least one pair of timpani is included though they rarely play continuously <sos> rather they serve to provide additional accents when needed <sos> in the 18th and 19th centuries other percussion instruments ( like the triangle or cymbals ) have been used again generally sparingly <sos> the use of percussion instruments became more frequent in the 20th century classical music <sos> in almost every style of music percussion plays a pivotal role <sos> in military marching bands and pipes and drums it is the beat of the bass drum that keeps the soldiers in step and at a regular speed and it is the snare that provides that crisp decisive air to the tune of a regiment <sos> in classic jazz one almost immediately thinks of the distinctive rhythm of the hi hats or the ride cymbal when the word "" swing "" is spoken <sos> in more recent popular music culture it is almost impossible to name three or four rock hip hop rap funk or even soul charts or songs that do not have some sort of percussive beat keeping the tune in time because of the diversity of percussive instruments it is not uncommon to find large musical ensembles composed entirely of percussion <sos> rhythm melody and harmony are all represented in these ensembles percussion notation [ edit ] <sos> main article : percussion notation <sos> music for pitched percussion instruments can be notated on a staff with the same treble and bass clefs used by many non percussive instruments <sos> music for percussive instruments without a definite pitch can be notated with a specialist rhythm or percussion clef ; more often a treble clef ( or sometimes a bass clef ) is substituted for rhythm clef <sos> classification [ edit ] <sos> main article : classification of percussion instruments <sos> see also : list of percussion instruments <sos> percussion instruments are classified by various criteria sometimes depending on their construction ethnic origin function within musical theory and orchestration or their relative prevalence in common knowledge <sos> the word "" percussion "" has evolved from latin terms : "" percussio "" ( which translates as "" to beat strike "" in the musical sense rather than the violent action ) and "" percussus "" ( which is a noun meaning "" a beating "" ) <sos> as a noun in contemporary english it is described in wiktionary as "" the collision of two bodies to produce a sound "" <sos> the usage of the term is not unique to music but has application in medicine and weaponry as in percussion cap but all known and common uses of the word "" percussion "" appear to share a similar lineage beginning with the original latin : "" percussus "" <sos> in a musical context then the term "" percussion instruments "" may have been coined originally to describe a family of musical instruments including drums rattles metal plates or blocks which musicians would beat or strike ( as in a collision ) to produce sound hornbostel–sachs has no high level section for percussion <sos> most percussion instruments ( as the term is normally understood ) are classified as idiophones and membranophones <sos> however the term percussion is instead used at lower levels of the hornbostel–sachs hierarchy including to identify instruments struck with either a non sonorous object ( hand stick striker ) or against a non sonorous object ( human body the ground ) – as opposed to concussion which refers to instruments in which two or more complementary sonorous parts are struck against each other – and for other purposes for example : 1111 concussion idiophones or clappers played in pairs and beaten against each other such as zills and clapsticks 1112 percussion idiophones includes many percussion instruments played with the hand or by a percussion mallet such as the hang gongs and the xylophone but not drums and only some cymbals 21 struck drums includes most types of drum such as the timpani snare drum and tom tom <sos> ( included in most drum sets or <sos> 41212 percussion reeds a class of wind instrument unrelated to percussion in the more common sense <sos> there are many instruments that have some claim to being percussion but are classified otherwise : <sos> keyboard instruments such as the celesta and piano [ 4 ] <sos> stringed instruments played with beaters such as the hammered dulcimer unpitched whistles and similar instruments such as the pea whistle and acme siren percussion beaters and sticks <sos> percussion instruments are sometimes classified as "" pitched "" or "" unpitched "" <sos> while valid this classification is widely seen as inadequate <sos> rather it may be more informative to describe percussion instruments in regards to one or more of the following four paradigms : <sos> by methods of sound production [ edit ] <sos> main article : hornbostel–sachs <sos> many texts including teaching percussion by gary cook of the university of arizona begin by studying the physical characteristics of instruments and the methods by which they can produce sound <sos> this is perhaps the most scientifically pleasing assignment of nomenclature whereas the other paradigms are more dependent on historical or social circumstances <sos> based on observation and experimentation one can determine how an instrument produces sound and then assign the instrument to one of the following four categories : <sos> idiophone [ edit ] <sos> main article : idiophone <sos> see also : category : idiophones <sos> "" idiophones produce sounds through the vibration of their entire body <sos> "" [ 5 ] examples of idiophones : <sos> bock a da bock <sos> cabasa <sos> cajón <sos>

jhallari <sos> aerophone [ edit ] <sos> main article : aerophone <sos> see also : category : aerophones <sos> most instruments known as "" aerophones "" are defined as wind instruments such as a saxophone whereby sound is produced by a person or thing blowing air through the object <sos> in a traditional ensemble setting aerophones are played by a percussionist generally due to the instrument ' s unconventional nature <sos> examples of aerophones played by percussionists : <sos> apito or samba whistle <sos> siren <sos> slide whistle <sos> whistle or police whistle <sos> by musical function or orchestration [ edit ] <sos> when classifying instruments by function it is useful to note if a percussion instrument makes a definite pitch or indefinite pitch for example some percussion instruments ( such as the marimba and timpani ) produce an obvious fundamental pitch and can therefore play melody and serve harmonic functions in music <sos> other instruments ( such as crash cymbals and snare drums ) produce sounds with such complex overtones and a wide range of prominent frequencies that no pitch is discernible definite pitch of music [ edit ] <sos> main article : pitched percussion instrument <sos> percussion instruments in this group are sometimes referred to as "" pitched "" or "" tuned "" <sos> examples of percussion instruments with definite pitch : <sos>

group are sometimes referred to as "" non pitched "" "" unpitched "" or "" untuned "" <sos> traditionally these instruments are thought of as making a sound that contains such complex frequencies that no discernible pitch can be heard <sos> in fact many traditionally unpitched instruments such as triangles and even cymbals have also been produced as tuned sets [ 3 ] <sos> examples of percussion instruments with indefinite pitch : <sos> bass drum <sos> castanets <sos> cymbals <sos> rainstick <sos> slapstick or whip <sos> snare drum <sos> tamtam <sos> tom tom <sos> by prevalence in common knowledge [ edit ] <sos> although it is difficult to define what is "" common knowledge "" there are instruments in use by percussionists and composers in contemporary music which are certainly not considered by most to be musical instruments of any kind <sos> therefore it is worthwhile to try to make distinction between instruments based on their acceptance or consideration by a general audience for example it is safe to argue that most people would not consider an anvil a brake drum ( the circular hub which houses the brake on the wheel of a motor vehicle ) or a fifty five gallon

as the rhythm section <sos> most classical pieces written for full orchestra since the time of haydn and mozart are orchestrated to place emphasis on the strings woodwinds and brass <sos> however often at least one pair of timpani is included though they rarely play continuously <sos> rather they serve to provide additional accents when needed <sos> in the 18th and 19th centuries other percussion instruments ( like the triangle or cymbals ) have been used again generally sparingly <sos> the use of percussion instruments became more frequent in the 20th century classical music <sos> in almost every style of music percussion plays a pivotal role <sos> in military marching bands and pipes and drums it is the beat of the bass drum that keeps the soldiers in step and at a regular speed and it is the snare that provides that crisp decisive air to the tune of a regiment <sos> in classic jazz one almost immediately thinks of the distinctive rhythm of the hi hats or the ride cymbal when the word "" swing "" is spoken <sos> in more recent popular music culture it is almost impossible to name three or four rock hip hop rap funk or even soul charts or songs that do not have some sort of percussive beat keeping the tune in time because of the diversity of percussive instruments it is not uncommon to find large musical ensembles composed entirely of percussion <sos> rhythm melody and harmony are all represented in these ensembles percussion notation [ edit ] <sos> main article : percussion notation <sos> music for pitched percussion instruments can be notated on a staff with the same treble and bass clefs used by many non percussive instruments <sos> music for percussive instruments without a definite pitch can be notated with a specialist rhythm or percussion clef ; more often a treble clef ( or sometimes a bass clef ) is substituted for rhythm clef <sos> classification [ edit ] <sos> main article : classification of percussion instruments <sos> see also : list of percussion instruments <sos> percussion instruments are classified by various criteria sometimes depending on their construction ethnic origin function within musical theory and orchestration or their relative prevalence in common knowledge <sos> the word "" percussion "" has evolved from latin terms : "" percussio "" ( which translates as "" to beat strike "" in the musical sense rather than the violent action ) and "" percussus "" ( which is a noun meaning "" a beating "" ) <sos> as a noun in contemporary english it is described in wiktionary as "" the collision of two bodies to produce a sound "" <sos> the usage of the term is not unique to music but has application in medicine and weaponry as in percussion cap but all known and common uses of the word "" percussion "" appear to share a similar lineage beginning with the original latin : "" percussus "" <sos> in a musical context then the term "" percussion instruments "" may have been coined originally to describe a family of musical instruments including drums rattles metal plates or blocks which musicians would beat or strike ( as in a collision ) to produce sound hornbostel–sachs has no high level section for percussion <sos> most percussion instruments ( as the term is normally understood ) are classified as idiophones and membranophones <sos> however the term percussion is instead used at lower levels of the hornbostel–sachs hierarchy including to identify instruments struck with either a non sonorous object ( hand stick striker ) or against a non sonorous object ( human body the ground ) – as opposed to concussion which refers to instruments in which two or more complementary sonorous parts are struck against each other – and for other purposes for example : 1111 concussion idiophones or clappers played in pairs and beaten against each other such as zills and clapsticks 1112 percussion idiophones includes many percussion instruments played with the hand or by a percussion mallet such as the hang gongs and the xylophone but not drums and only some cymbals 21 struck drums includes most types of drum such as the timpani snare drum and tom tom <sos> ( included in most drum sets or <sos> 41212 percussion reeds a class of wind instrument unrelated to percussion in the more common sense <sos> there are many instruments that have some claim to being percussion but are classified otherwise : <sos> keyboard instruments such as the celesta and piano [ 4 ] <sos> stringed instruments played with beaters such as the hammered dulcimer unpitched whistles and similar instruments such as the pea whistle and acme siren percussion beaters and sticks <sos> percussion instruments are sometimes classified as "" pitched "" or "" unpitched "" <sos> while valid this classification is widely seen as inadequate <sos> rather it may be more informative to describe percussion instruments in regards to one or more of the following four paradigms : <sos> by methods of sound production [ edit ] <sos> main article : hornbostel–sachs <sos> many texts including teaching percussion by gary cook of the university of arizona begin by studying the physical characteristics of instruments and the methods by which they can produce sound <sos> this is perhaps the most scientifically pleasing assignment of nomenclature whereas the other paradigms are more dependent on historical or social circumstances <sos> based on observation and experimentation one can determine how an instrument produces sound and then assign the instrument to one of the following four categories : <sos> idiophone [ edit ] <sos> main article : idiophone <sos> see also : category : idiophones <sos> "" idiophones produce sounds through the vibration of their entire body <sos> "" [ 5 ] examples of idiophones :

percussionist generally due to the instrument ' s unconventional nature <sos> examples of aerophones played by percussionists : <sos> apito or samba whistle <sos> siren <sos> slide whistle <sos> whistle or police whistle <sos> by musical function or orchestration [ edit ] <sos> when classifying instruments by function it is useful to note if a percussion instrument makes a definite pitch or indefinite pitch for example some percussion instruments ( such as the marimba and timpani ) produce an obvious fundamental pitch and can therefore play melody and serve harmonic functions in music <sos> other instruments ( such as crash cymbals and snare drums ) produce sounds with such complex overtones and a wide range of prominent frequencies that no pitch is discernible definite pitch of music [ edit ] <sos> main article : pitched percussion instrument <sos> percussion instruments in this group are sometimes referred to as "" pitched "" or "" tuned "" <sos> examples of percussion

instrument <sos> instruments in this group are sometimes referred to as "" non pitched "" "" unpitched "" or "" untuned "" <sos> traditionally these instruments are thought of as making a sound that contains such complex frequencies that no discernible pitch can be heard <sos> in fact many traditionally unpitched instruments such as triangles and even cymbals have also been produced as tuned sets

<sos> by prevalence in common knowledge [ edit ] <sos> although it is difficult to define what is "" common knowledge "" there are instruments in use by percussionists and composers in contemporary music which are certainly not considered by most to be musical instruments of any kind <sos> therefore it is worthwhile to try to make distinction between instruments based on their acceptance or consideration by a general audience for example it is safe to argue that most people would not consider an anvil a brake drum ( the circular hub which houses the brake on the wheel of a motor vehicle ) or a fifty five gallon oil barrel to be musical instruments yet these objects can be used by composers and percussionists of modern music one might assign various percussion instruments to one of

sometimes the guitarist are referred to as the rhythm section <sos> most classical pieces written for full orchestra since the time of haydn and mozart are orchestrated to place emphasis on the strings woodwinds and brass <sos> however often at least one pair of timpani is included though they rarely play continuously <sos> rather they serve to provide additional accents when needed <sos> in the 18th and 19th centuries other percussion instruments ( like the triangle or cymbals ) have been used again generally sparingly <sos> the use of percussion instruments became more frequent in the 20th century classical music <sos> in almost every style of music percussion plays a pivotal role <sos> in military marching bands and pipes and drums it is the beat of the bass drum that keeps the soldiers in step and at a regular speed and it is the snare that provides that crisp decisive air to the tune of a regiment <sos> in classic jazz one almost immediately thinks of the distinctive rhythm of the hi hats or the ride cymbal when the word "" swing "" is spoken <sos> in more recent popular music culture it is almost impossible to name three or four rock hip hop rap funk or even soul charts or songs that do not have some sort of percussive beat keeping the tune in time because of the diversity of percussive instruments it is not uncommon to find large musical ensembles composed entirely of percussion <sos> rhythm melody and harmony are all represented in these ensembles percussion notation [ edit ] <sos> main article : percussion notation <sos> music for pitched percussion instruments can be notated on a staff with the same treble and bass clefs used by many non percussive instruments <sos> music for percussive instruments without a definite pitch can be notated with a

percussion instruments <sos> see also : list of percussion instruments <sos> percussion instruments are classified by various criteria sometimes depending on their construction ethnic origin function within musical theory and orchestration or their relative prevalence in common knowledge <sos> the word "" percussion "" has evolved from latin terms : "" percussio "" ( which translates as "" to beat strike "" in the musical sense rather than the violent action ) and "" percussus "" ( which is a noun meaning "" a beating "" ) <sos> as a noun in contemporary english it is described in wiktionary as "" the collision of two bodies to produce a sound "" <sos> the usage of the term is not unique to music but has application in medicine and weaponry as in percussion cap but all known and common uses of the word "" percussion "" appear to share a similar lineage beginning with the original latin : "" percussus "" <sos> in a musical context then the term "" percussion instruments "" may have been coined originally to describe a family of musical instruments including drums rattles metal plates or blocks which musicians would beat or strike ( as in a collision ) to produce sound hornbostel–sachs has no high level section for percussion <sos> most percussion instruments ( as the term is normally understood ) are classified as idiophones and membranophones <sos> however the term percussion is instead used at lower levels of the hornbostel–sachs hierarchy including to identify instruments struck with either a non sonorous object ( hand stick striker ) or against a non sonorous object ( human body the ground ) – as opposed to concussion which refers to instruments in which two or more complementary sonorous parts are struck against each other – and for other purposes for example : 1111 concussion idiophones or clappers played in pairs and beaten against each other such as zills and clapsticks 1112 percussion idiophones includes many percussion instruments played with the hand or by a percussion mallet such as the hang gongs and the xylophone but not drums and only some cymbals 21 struck drums includes most types of drum such as the timpani snare drum and tom tom <sos> ( included in most drum sets or <sos> 41212 percussion reeds a class of wind instrument unrelated to percussion in the more common sense <sos> there are many instruments that have some claim to being percussion but are classified otherwise : <sos> keyboard instruments such as the celesta and piano [ 4 ] <sos> stringed instruments played with beaters such as the hammered dulcimer unpitched whistles and similar instruments such as the pea whistle and acme siren percussion beaters and sticks <sos> percussion instruments are sometimes classified as "" pitched "" or "" unpitched "" <sos> while valid this classification is widely seen as inadequate <sos> rather it may be more informative to describe percussion instruments in regards to one or more of the following four paradigms : <sos> by methods of sound production [ edit ] <sos> main article : hornbostel–sachs <sos> many texts including teaching percussion by gary cook of the university of arizona begin by studying the physical characteristics of instruments and the methods by which they can produce sound <sos> this is perhaps the most scientifically pleasing assignment of nomenclature whereas the other paradigms are more dependent on historical or social circumstances <sos> based on observation and experimentation one can determine how an instrument produces sound and then assign the instrument to one of the following four categories : <sos> idiophone [ edit ] <sos> main article : idiophone <sos> see also : category : idiophones <sos> "" idiophones produce sounds through the vibration of their

samba whistle <sos> siren <sos> slide whistle <sos> whistle or police whistle <sos> by musical function or orchestration [ edit ] <sos> when classifying instruments by function it is useful to note if a percussion instrument makes a definite pitch or indefinite pitch for example some percussion instruments ( such as the marimba and timpani ) produce an obvious fundamental pitch and can therefore play melody and serve harmonic functions in music <sos> other instruments ( such as crash cymbals and snare drums ) produce sounds with such complex overtones and a wide range of prominent frequencies

use by percussionists and composers in contemporary music which are certainly not considered by most to be musical instruments of any kind <sos> therefore it is worthwhile to try to make distinction between instruments based on their acceptance or consideration by a general audience for example it is safe to argue that most people would not consider an anvil a brake drum ( the circular hub which houses the brake on the wheel of a motor vehicle ) or a fifty five gallon oil barrel to be musical instruments yet these objects can be used by composers and percussionists of modern music one might

include either one or both custom percussion players <sos> along with custom made deep sounding drums their play includes hitting baseball bats and other objects on beer kegs to create a distinctive sound by cultural significance or tradition [ edit ] <sos> it is not uncommon to discuss percussion instruments in relation to their cultural origin <sos> this has led to a division between

most highly centralised of any state in australia with more than 75 percent of south australians living in the capital adelaide or its environs <sos> other population centres in the state are relatively small south australia shares borders with all of the other mainland states and with the northern territory ; it is bordered to the west by western australia to the north by the northern territory to the north east by queensland to the east by new south wales to the south east by victoria and to the south by the great australian bight <sos> [ 4 ] the state comprises less than 8 percent of the australian population and ranks fifth in population among the six states and two territories <sos> the majority of its people reside in greater metropolitan adelaide <sos> most of the remainder are settled in fertile areas along the south eastern coast and river murray <sos> the state ' s colonial origins are unique in australia as a freely settled planned british province [ 5 ] rather than as a convict settlement <sos> colonial government commenced on 28 december 1836 when the members of the council were sworn in near the old gum tree as with the rest of the continent the region had been long occupied by aboriginal peoples who were organised into numerous tribes and languages <sos> the south australian company established a temporary settlement at kingscote kangaroo island on 26 july 1836 five months before adelaide was founded <sos> [ 6 ] the guiding principle behind settlement was that of systematic colonisation a theory espoused by edward gibbon wakefield that was later employed by the new zealand company <sos> [ citation needed ] the goal was to establish the province as a centre of civilisation for free immigrants promising civil liberties and religious tolerance <sos> although its history is marked by economic hardship south australia has remained politically innovative and culturally vibrant <sos> today it is known for its fine wine and numerous cultural festivals <sos> the state ' s economy is dominated by the agricultural manufacturing and mining industries <sos> the state has an increasingly significant finance sector as well <sos> [

with flint mining activity and rock art in the koonalda cave on the nullarbor plain <sos> in addition wooden spears and tools were made in an area now covered in peat bog in the south east <sos> kangaroo island was inhabited long before the island was cut off by rising sea levels <sos> [ 7 ] the first recorded european sighting of the south australian coast was in 1627 when the dutch ship the gulden zeepaert captained by françois thijssen examined and mapped a section of the coastline as far east as the nuyts archipelago <sos> thijssen named his discovery "" pieter nuyts land "" after the highest ranking individual on board <sos> [ citation needed ] <sos> the coastline of south australia was first mapped by matthew flinders and nicolas baudin in 1802 excepting the inlet later named the port adelaide river which was first discovered in 1831 by captain collet barker and later accurately charted in 1836 37 by colonel william light leader of the south australian colonization commissioners ' ' first expedition ' and first surveyor general of south australia <sos> the land which now forms the state of south australia was claimed for britain in 1788 as part of the colony of new south wales <sos> although the new colony included almost two thirds of the continent early settlements were all on the eastern coast and only a few intrepid explorers ventured this far west <sos> it took more than forty years before any serious proposal to establish settlements in the south western portion of new south wales were put forward on 15 august 1834 the british parliament passed the south australia act 1834 ( foundation act ) which empowered his majesty to erect and establish a province or provinces in southern australia <sos> the act stated that 802511 square kilometres ( 309851 sq mi ) would be allotted to the colony and it would be convict free <sos> in contrast to the rest of australia terra nullius did not apply to the new province <sos> the letters of patent [ 8 ] which used the enabling provisions of the south australia act 1834 to fix the boundaries of the province of south australia provided that ' nothing in those our letters patent shall affect or be construed to affect the rights of any aboriginal natives of the said province to the actual occupation and enjoyment in their own persons or in the persons of their descendants of any lands therein now actually occupied or enjoyed by such natives ' <sos> [ 8 ] although the patent guaranteed land rights under force of law for the indigenous inhabitants it was ignored by the south australian company authorities and squatters [ 9 ] <sos> nicolas baudin who mapped the coastline of south australia along with matthew flinders survey was required before settlement of the province and the colonization commissioners for south australia appointed william light as the leader of its ' first expedition ' tasked with examining 1500 miles of the south australian coastline and selecting the best site for the capital and with then planning and surveying the site of the city into one acre town sections and its surrounds into 134 acre country sections <sos> eager to commence the establishment of their whale and seal fisheries the south australian company sought and obtained the commissioners ' permission to send company ships to south australia in advance of the surveys and ahead of the commissioners ' colonists <sos> the company ' s settlement of seven vessels and 636 people was temporarily made at kingscote on kangaroo island until the official site of the capital was selected by william light where the city of adelaide is currently located <sos> the first immigrants arrived at holdfast bay ( near the present day glenelg ) in november 1836 <sos> the commencement of colonial government was proclaimed on 28 december 1836 now known as proclamation day south australia was the second australian state to be settled by free colonists the first being the free swan river colony in western australia however in 1849 western australia was formally constituted as a penal colony <sos> although south australia was constituted such that convicts could never be transported to the province some emancipated or escaped convicts or expirees made their own way there both prior to 1836 or later and may have constituted 1 2% of the early population [ 10 ] <sos> the plan for the province was that it would be an experiment in reform addressing the problems perceived in british society <sos> there was to be religious freedom and no established religion <sos> sales of land to colonists created an emigration fund to pay the costs of transferring a poor young labouring population to south australia <sos> in early 1838 the colonists became concerned after it was reported that convicts who had escaped from the eastern states may make their way to south australia <sos> the south australia police was formed in april 1838 to protect the community and enforce government regulations <sos> their principal role was to run the first temporary gaol a two room hut [ 11 ] <sos> the current flag of south australia was adopted on 13 january 1904 and is a british blue ensign defaced with the state badge <sos> the badge is described as a piping shrike with wings outstretched on a yellow disc <sos> the state badge is believed to have been designed by robert craig of
